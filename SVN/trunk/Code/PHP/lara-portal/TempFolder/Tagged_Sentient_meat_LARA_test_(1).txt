“They|’re#be# made#make##make# out of meat.”

“Meat?”

“Meat. They|’re#be# made#make##make# out of meat.”

“Meat?”

“There|’s#be/have/s# no doubt about it. We picked#pick##pick# up several from different parts#part##part# of the planet, took#take##take# them#they##they# aboard our#we##we# recon vessels#vessel##vessel#, and probed#probe##probe# them#they##they# all the way through. They|’re#be# completely meat.”

“That|’s#be/have/s# impossible. What about the radio signals#signal##signal#? The messages#message##message# to the stars#star##star#?”

“They use the radio waves#wave##wave# to talk, but the signals#signal##signal# do|n’t#not# come from them#they##they#. The signals#signal##signal# come from machines#machine##machine#.”

“So who made#make##make# the machines#machine##machine#? That|’s#be/have/s# who we want to contact.”

“They made#make##make# the machines#machine##machine#. That|’s#be/have/s# what I|’m#be# trying#try##try# to tell you. Meat made#make##make# the machines#machine##machine#.”

“That|’s#be/have/s# ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You|’re#be# asking#ask##ask# me#i##i# to believe in sentient meat.”

“I|’m#be# not asking#ask##ask# you, I|’m#be# telling#tell##tell# you. These creatures#creature##creature# are#be##be# the only sentient race in that sector and they|’re#be# made#make##make# out of meat.”

“Maybe they|’re#be# like the orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence that goes#go##go# through a meat stage.”

“Nope. They|’re#be# born#bear##bear# meat and they die meat. We studied#study##study# them#they##they# for several of their#they##they# life spans#span##span#, which did#do##do#|n’t#not# take long. Do you have any idea what|’s#be/have/s# the life span of meat?”

“Spare me#i##i#. Okay, maybe they|’re#be# only part meat. You know, like the weddilei. A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside.”

“Nope. We thought#think##think# of that, since they do have meat heads#head##head#, like the weddilei. But I told#tell##tell# you, we probed#probe##probe# them#they##they#. They|’re#be# meat all the way through.”

“No brain?”

“Oh, there|’s#be/have/s# a brain all right. It|’s#be/have/s# just that the brain is#be##be# made#make##make# out of meat! That|’s#be/have/s# what I|’ve#have# been#be##be# trying#try##try# to tell you.”

“So . . . what does#do##do# the thinking?”

“You|’re#be# not understanding, are#be##be# you? You|’re#be# refusing#refuse##refuse# to deal with what I|’m#be# telling#tell##tell# you. The brain does#do##do# the thinking. The meat.”

“Thinking meat! You|’re#be# asking#ask##ask# me#i##i# to believe in thinking meat!”

“Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming#dream##dream# meat. The meat is#be##be# the whole deal! Are#be##be# you beginning#begin##begin# to get the picture or do I have to start all over?”

“Omigod#Omigod##Omigod#. You|’re#be# serious then. They|’re#be# made#make##make# out of meat.”

“Thank you. Finally. Yes. They are#be##be# indeed made#make##make# out of meat. And they|’ve#have# been#be##be# trying#try##try# to get in touch with us#we##we# for almost a hundred of their#they##they# years#year##year#.”

“Omigod#Omigod##Omigod#. So what does#do##do# this meat have in mind?”

“First it wants#want##want# to talk to us#we##we#. Then I imagine it wants#want##want# to explore the Universe, contact other sentiences, swap ideas#idea##idea# and information. The usual.”

“We|’re#be# supposed#suppose##suppose# to talk to meat.”

“That|’s#be/have/s# the idea. That|’s#be/have/s# the message they|’re#be# sending#send##send# out by radio. ‘Hello. Anyone out there? Anybody home?’ That sort of thing.”

“They actually do talk, then. They use words#word##word#, ideas#idea##idea#, concepts#concept##concept#?”

“Oh, yes. Except they do it with meat.”

“I thought#think##think# you just told#tell##tell# me#i##i# they used#use##use# radio.”

“They do, but what do you think is#be##be# on the radio? Meat sounds#sound##sound#. You know how when you slap or flap meat, it makes#make##make# a noise? They talk by flapping#flap##flap# their#they##they# meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting#squirt##squirt# air through their#they##they# meat.”

“Omigod#Omigod##Omigod#. Singing#sing##sing# meat. This is#be##be# altogether too much. So what do you advise?”

“Officially or unofficially?”

“Both.”

“Officially, we are#be##be# required#require##require# to contact, welcome, and log in any and all sentient races#race##race# or multibeings in this quadrant of the Universe, without prejudice, fear, or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records#record##record# and forget the whole thing.”

“I was#be##be# hoping#hope##hope# you would say that.”

“It seems#seem##seem# harsh, but there is#be##be# a limit. Do we really want to make contact with meat?”

“I agree one hundred percent. What|’s#be/have/s# there to say? ‘Hello, meat. How|’s#be/have/s# it going#go##go#?’ But will this work? How many planets#planet##planet# are#be##be# we dealing#deal##deal# with here?”

“Just one. They can travel to other planets#planet##planet# in special meat containers#container##container#, but they ca#can##can#|n’t#not# live on them#they##they#. And being#be##be# meat, they can only travel through C space. Which limits#limit##limit# them#they##they# to the speed of light and makes#make##make# the possibility of their#they##they# ever making#make##make# contact pretty slim. Infinitesimal, in fact.”

“So we just pretend there|’s#be/have/s# no one home in the Universe.”

“That|’s#be/have/s# it.”

“Cruel. But you said#say##say# it yourself, who wants#want##want# to meet meat? And the ones#one##one# who have been#be##be# aboard our#we##we# vessels#vessel##vessel#, the ones#one##one# you probed#probe##probe#? You|’re#be# sure they wo#will##will#|n’t#not# remember?”

“They|’ll#will# be considered#consider##consider# crackpots#crackpot##crackpot# if they do. We went#go##go# into their#they##they# heads#head##head# and smoothed#smooth##smooth# out their#they##they# meat so that we|’re#be# just a dream to them#they##they#.”

“A dream to meat! How strangely appropriate, that we should be meat|’s#be/have/s# dream.”

“And we marked#mark##mark# the entire sector unoccupied.”

“Good. Agreed#agree##agree#, officially and unofficially. Case closed#close##close#. Any others#other##other#? Anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy?”

“Yes, a rather shy but sweet hydrogen-core cluster intelligence in a class-nine star in G445#G445##G445# zone was#be##be# in contact two galactic rotations#rotation##rotation# ago, wants#want##want# to be friendly again.”

“They always come around.”

“And why not? Imagine how unbearably, how unutterably cold the Universe would be if one were#be##be# all alone . . . ”
