<p>About this Book and the Barngarla Language Reclamation: Based on material recorded by Revd Clamor Wilhelm Schürmann in the 1840s, the Barngarla language reclamation has been undertaken since 2011 by Professor Ghil‘ad Zuckermann, Chair of Linguistics and Endangered Languages at the University of Adelaide, working with the Barngarla Language Advisory Committee (BLAC) on behalf of the Barngarla communities of Port Lincoln (Galinyala), Whyalla (Waiala) and Port Augusta (Goordnada). </p>
<p>This book has been developed by revivalist-linguist Professor Ghil‘ad Zuckermann (The University of Adelaide). It is meant to assist the Barngarla community in continuing their project to reclaim their ‘Dreaming, Sleeping Beauty’ tongue. The creation of the book was supported by ILA (Indigenous Languages & Arts, Department of Communications & the Arts, Government of Australia), NHMRC, Hakeem Beedar, Petter Naessan and the Barngarla Language Advisory Committee (BLAC). </p>
