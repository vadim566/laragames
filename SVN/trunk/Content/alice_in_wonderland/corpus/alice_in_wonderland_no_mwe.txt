<page><h2>CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-|Hole||</h2>

Alice was#be# beginning#begin# to get very tired#tire# of sitting#sit# by her sister on the
bank, and of having#have# nothing to do:|| once or twice she had#have# peeped#peep# into the
book her sister was#be# reading#read#, but it had#have# no pictures#picture# or conversations#conversation# in
it, ‘and what is#be# the use of a book,’ thought#think# Alice ‘without pictures#picture# or
conversations#conversation#?’||

So she was#be# considering#consider# in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made#make# her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
of making#make# a daisy-|chain would be worth the trouble of getting#get# up and
picking#pick# the daisies#daisy#,|| when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes#eye# ran#run#
close by her.||

There was#be# nothing so <i>very</i> remarkable in that; nor did#do# Alice think it so
<i>very</i> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘@Oh dear@!||
@Oh dear@!|| I shall be late!’||<page>(when she thought#think# it over afterwards, it
occurred#occur# to her that she ought to have wondered#wonder# at this, but at the time
it all seemed#seem# quite natural);|| but when the Rabbit actually <i>took#take# a watch
out of its waistcoat-|pocket</i>, and looked#look# at it, and then hurried#hurry# on,
Alice started#start# to her feet#foot#,|| for it flashed#flash# across her mind that she had#have#
never before seen#see# a rabbit with either a waistcoat-|pocket, or a watch
to take out of it,|| and burning#burn# with curiosity, she ran#run# across the field
after it, and fortunately was#be# just in time to see it pop down a large
rabbit-|hole under the hedge.||
<img src="01TookAWatchOutOfHisWaistcoatPocket.jpg" width="204" height="304" alt="The White Rabbit looks at his watch"/>

In another moment down went#go# Alice after it, never once considering#consider# how
in the world she was#be# to get out again.||<page>

The rabbit-|hole went#go# straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped#dip# suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had#have# not a moment to think
about stopping#stop# herself before she found#find# herself falling#fall# down a very deep
well.||

Either the well was#be# very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had#have#
plenty of time as she went#go# down to look about her and to wonder what was#be#
going#go# to happen next.||First, she tried#try# to look down and make out what
she was#be# coming#come# to, but it was#be# too dark to see anything;|| then she
looked#look# at the sides#side# of the well, and noticed#notice# that they were#be# filled#fill# with
cupboards#cupboard# and book-|shelves#shelf#; here and there she saw#see# maps#map# and pictures#picture#
hung#hang# upon pegs#peg#.|| She took#take# down a jar from one of the shelves#shelf# as
she passed#pass#; it was#be# labelled#label# ‘ORANGE MARMALADE’, but to her great
disappointment it was#be# empty:|| she did#do# not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing#kill# somebody, so managed#manage# to put it into one of the cupboards#cupboard# as
she fell past it.||

<page>‘Well!’ thought#think# Alice#alice# to herself, ‘after such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling#tumble# down stairs#stair#!|| How brave they|’ll#will# all think me at
home!|| Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top
of the house!’ (Which was#be# very likely true.)||

Down, down, down. Would the fall <i>never</i> come to an end!|| ‘I wonder how
many miles#mile# I|’ve#have# fallen#fall# by this time?’ she said#say# aloud.|| ‘I must be getting#get#
somewhere near the centre of the earth.|| Let me see: that would be four
thousand miles#mile# down, I think--’|| (for, you see, Alice had#have# learnt#learn# several
things#thing# of this sort in her lessons#lesson# in the schoolroom, and though this
was#be# not a <i>very</i> good opportunity for showing#show# off her knowledge, as there
was#be# no one to listen to her, still it was#be# good practice to say it over)||
‘--yes, that|’s#be# about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude#latitude#
or Longitude#longitude# I|’ve#have# got#get# to?’ (Alice had#have# no idea what Latitude was#be#, or
Longitude either, but thought#think# they were#be# nice grand words#word# to say.)||

<page>Presently she began#begin# again. ‘I wonder if I shall fall right <i>through</i> the
earth!|| How funny it|’ll#will# seem to come out among the people that walk with
their heads#head# downward!|| The Antipathies#antipathy#, I think--’ (she was#be# rather glad
there <i>was#be#</i> no one listening#listen#, this time, as it didn’t sound @at all@ the
right word) ‘--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country
is#be#, you know.|| Please, Ma’am, is#be# this @New Zealand@#new zealand# or Australia#australia#?’ (and
she tried#try# to curtsey as she spoke#speak#--fancy <i>curtseying</i>#curtsey# as you|’re#be# falling#fall#
through the air! Do you think you could manage it?)|| ‘And what an
ignorant little girl she|’ll#will# think me for asking#ask#! No, it|’ll#will# never do to
ask: perhaps I shall see it written#write# up somewhere.’

Down, down, down. There was#be# nothing else to do, so Alice soon began#begin#
talking#talk# again.|| ‘Dinah|’ll#will# miss me very much tonight, I should think!’
(Dinah was#be# the cat.)|| ‘I hope they|’ll#will# remember her saucer of milk at
tea-|time.|| Dinah my dear! I wish you were#be# down here with me!|| There are#be# no
mice#mouse# in the air, I|’m#be# afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that|’s#be# very
like a mouse, you know.|| But do cats#cat# eat bats#bat#, I wonder?’||<page>And#and# here Alice
began#begin# to get rather sleepy, and went#go# on saying#say# to herself, in a dreamy
sort of way, ‘Do cats#cat# eat bats#bat#? Do cats#cat# eat bats#bat#?’ and sometimes, ‘Do
bats#bat# eat cats#cat#?’|| for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question,
it didn’t much matter which way she put it.|| She felt#feel# that she was#be# dozing#doze#
off, and had#have# just begun#begin# to dream that she was#be# walking#walk# hand in hand with
Dinah, and saying#say# to her very earnestly, ‘Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:
did#do# you ever eat a bat?’|| when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came#come# upon
a heap of sticks#stick# and dry leaves#leaf#, and the fall was#be# over.||

Alice was#be# not a bit hurt, and she jumped#jump# up on to her feet#foot# in a moment:||
she looked#look# up, but it was#be# all dark overhead; before her was#be# another
long passage, and the White#white# Rabbit was#be# still in sight, hurrying#hurry# down it.||
There was#be# not a moment to be lost#lose#: away went#go# Alice like the wind, and
was#be# just in time to hear it say, as it turned#turn# a corner, ‘Oh my ears#ear#
and whiskers#whisker#, how late it|’s#be# getting#get#!’|| She was#be# close behind it when she
turned#turn# the corner, but the Rabbit was#be# no longer#long# to be seen#see#:|| she found#find#
herself in a long, low hall, which was#be# lit#light# up by a row of lamps#lamp# hanging#hang#
from the roof.||

<page>There were#be# doors#door# all round the hall, but they were#be# all locked#lock#;|| and when
Alice had#have# been#be# all the way down one side and up the other, trying#try# every
door, she walked#walk# sadly down the middle, wondering#wonder# how she was#be# ever to
get out again.||

Suddenly she came#come# upon a little three-legged table, all made#make# of solid
glass;|| there was#be# nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice|’s
first thought#think# was#be# that it might belong to one of the doors#door# of the hall;||
but, alas! either the locks#lock# were#be# too large, or the key was#be# too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them.|| However, on the second
time round, she came#come# upon a low curtain she had#have# not noticed#notice# before, and
behind it was#be# a little door about fifteen inches#inch# high:|| she tried#try# the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted#fit#!||
<img src="02ALowCurtainSheHadNotNoticedBefore.jpg" width="239" height="243" alt="Alice finds the little door"/><page>

Alice opened#open# the door and found#find# that it led#lead# into a small passage, not
much larger#large# than a rat-|hole: she knelt#kneel# down and looked#look# along the passage
into the loveliest#lovely# garden you ever saw#see#.|| How she longed#long# to get out of
that dark hall, and wander about among those beds#bed# of bright flowers#flower# and
those cool fountains#fountain#, but she could not even get her head through the
doorway;||‘and even if my head would go through,’ thought#think# poor Alice, ‘it
would be of very little use without my shoulders#shoulder#.|| Oh, how I wish I could
shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew#know# how to begin.’||
For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things#thing# had#have# happened#happen# lately,
that Alice had#have# begun#begin# to think that very few things#thing# indeed were#be# really
impossible.||

There seemed#seem# to be no use in waiting#wait# by the little door, so she went#go#
back to the table, half hoping#hope# she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules#rule# for shutting#shut# people up like telescopes#telescope#:|| this
time she found#find# a little bottle on it, (‘which certainly was#be# not here
before,’ said#say# Alice,)|| and round the neck of the bottle was#be# a paper
label, with the words#word# ‘DRINK#drink# ME#me#’ beautifully printed#print# on it in large
letters#letter#.||<page> 
<img src="03DrinkMe.jpg" width="209" height="288" alt="Alice picks up the little bottle"/>

It was#be# all very well to say ‘Drink me,’ but the wise little Alice was#be#
not going#go# to do <i>that</i> in a hurry.|| ‘No, I|’ll#will# look first,’ she said#say#, ‘and
see whether it|’s#be# marked#mark# “poison” or not’;|| for she had#have# read several nice
little histories#history# about children#child# who had#have# got#get# burnt#burn#, and eaten#eat# up by wild
beasts#beast# and other unpleasant things#thing#,|| all because they <i>would</i> not remember
the simple rules#rule# their friends#friend# had#have# taught#teach# them: such as, that a red-#red#|hot
poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your
finger <i>very</i> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds#bleed#;|| and she had#have# never
forgotten#forget# that, if you drink much from a bottle marked#mark# ‘poison,’ it is#be#
almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later#late#.||<page> 

However, this bottle was#be# <i>not</i> marked#mark# ‘poison,’ so Alice ventured#venture# to taste
it,|| and finding#find# it very nice, (it had#have#, in fact, a sort of mixed#mix# flavour
of cherry-#cherry#|tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot
buttered#butter# toast,) she very soon finished#finish# it off.||

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

||‘What a curious feeling!’ said#say# Alice; ‘I must be shutting#shut# up like a
telescope.’||

And so it was#be# indeed: she was#be# now only ten inches#inch# high, and her face
brightened#brighten# up at the thought that she was#be# now the right size for going#go#
through the little door into that lovely garden.|| First, however, she
waited#wait# for a few minutes#minute# to see if she was#be# going#go# to shrink any further:||
<page>she felt#feel# a little nervous about this; ‘for it might end, you know,’ said#say#
Alice to herself, ‘in my going#go# out altogether, like a candle.|| I wonder
what I should be like then?’ And she tried#try# to fancy what the flame of a
candle is#be# like after the candle is#be# blown#blow# out, for she could not remember
ever having#have# seen#see# such a thing.||

After a while, finding#find# that nothing more happened#happen#, she decided#decide# on going#go#
into the garden @at once@;|| but, alas#alas# for poor Alice! when she got#get# to the
door, she found#find# she had#have# forgotten#forget# the little golden key,|| and when she
went#go# back to the table for it, she found#find# she could not possibly reach
it:|| she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried#try# her
best to climb up one of the legs#leg# of the table, but it was#be# too slippery;||
and when she had#have# tired#tire# herself out with trying#try#, the poor little thing
@sat down@#sit down# and cried#cry#.||

‘Come, there|’s#be# no use in crying#cry# like that!’ said#say# Alice to herself,
rather sharply; ‘I advise you to @leave off@ this minute!’|| She generally
gave#give# herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed#follow# it),
and sometimes she scolded#scold# herself so severely as to bring tears#tear# into
her eyes#eye#;|| <page>and once she remembered#remember# trying#try# to box her own ears#ear# for having#have#
cheated#cheat# herself in a game of croquet she was#be# playing#play# against herself,||
for this curious child was#be# very fond of pretending#pretend# to be two people.||
‘But it|’s#be# no use now,’ thought#think# poor Alice, ‘to pretend to be two people!
Why, there|’s#be# hardly enough of me left#leave# to make <i>one</i> respectable person!’

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was#be# lying#lie# under the table:||
she opened#open# it, and found#find# in it a very small cake, on which the words#word#
‘EAT ME’ were#be# beautifully marked#mark# in currants#currant#.|| ‘Well, I|’ll#will# eat it,’ said#say#
Alice,|| ‘and if it makes#make# me grow larger#large#, I can reach the key; and if it
makes#make# me grow smaller#small#, I can creep under the door;|| so either way I|’ll#will#
get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens#happen#!’

She ate#eat# a little bit, and said#say# anxiously to herself, ‘Which way? Which
way?’, holding#hold# her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was#be#
growing#grow#,|| and she was#be# quite surprised#surprise# to find that she remained#remain# the same
size:|| <page>to be sure, this generally happens#happen# when one eats#eat# cake, but Alice
had#have# got#get# so much into the way of expecting#expect# nothing but out-of-the-way
things#thing# to happen, that it seemed#seem# quite dull and stupid for life to go on
in the common way.||

So she set to work, and very soon finished#finish# off the cake.||

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *




||<page><h2>CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears#tear#||</h2>

‘Curiouser and curiouser!’ cried#cry# Alice|| (she was#be# so much surprised#surprise#, that
for the moment she quite forgot#forget# how to speak good English#english#);|| ‘now I|’m#be#
opening#open# out like the largest#large# telescope that ever was#be#!|| Good-bye#good-bye#, feet#foot#!’
(for when she looked#look# down at her feet#foot#, they seemed#seem# to be almost out of
sight, they were#be# getting#get# so far off).|| ‘Oh, my poor little feet#foot#, I wonder
who will put on your shoes#shoe# and stockings#stocking# for you now, dears#dear#?|| I|’m#be# sure
<i>I</i> shan’t be able!|| I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;||--but I must be
kind to them,’ thought#think# Alice, ‘or perhaps they won’t walk the way I want
to go!|| Let me see: I|’ll#will# give them a new pair of boots#boot# every Christmas.’||
<img src="04CuriouserAndCuriouser.jpg" width="139" height="348" alt="Alice is very tall"/><page>

And she went#go# on planning to herself how she would manage it.|| ‘They must
go by the carrier,’ she thought#think#; ‘and how funny it|’ll#will# seem, sending#send#
presents#present# to one|’s own feet#foot#! And#and# how odd the directions#direction# will look!||

     <i>Alice|’s right foot, Esq.
       hearthrug,
         near the fender,
           (with Alice|’s love).</i>||

@Oh dear@, what nonsense I|’m#be# talking#talk#!’||

Just then her head struck#strike# against the roof of the hall:|| in fact she was#be#
now more than nine feet#foot# high, and she @at once@ took#take# up the little golden
key and hurried#hurry# off to the garden door.||

Poor Alice!|| It was#be# as much as she could do, lying#lie# down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was#be# more
hopeless than ever: she @sat down@#sit down# and began#begin# to cry again.||

‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself,’ said#say# Alice, ‘a great girl like
you,’ (she might well say this), ‘to go on crying#cry# in this way! Stop#stop# this
moment, I tell you!’|| But she went#go# on all the same, shedding#shed# gallons#gallon# of
tears#tear#, until there was#be# a large pool all round her, about four inches#inch#
deep and reaching#reach# half down the hall.||

<page>After a time she heard#hear# a little pattering of feet#foot# in the distance, and
she hastily dried#dry# her eyes#eye# to see what was#be# coming#come#.|| It was#be# the White
Rabbit returning#return#, splendidly dressed#dress#, with a pair of white kid gloves#glove# in
one hand and a large fan in the other:|| he came#come# trotting#trot# along in a great
hurry, muttering#mutter# to himself as he came#come#, ‘Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!||
Oh! won’t she be savage if I|’ve#have# kept#keep# her waiting#wait#!’|| Alice felt#feel# so
desperate that she was#be# ready to ask help of any one;|| so, when the Rabbit
came#come# near her, she began#begin#, in a low, timid voice, ‘If you please, sir--’||
The Rabbit started#start# violently, dropped#drop# the white kid gloves#glove# and the fan,
and scurried#scurry# away into the darkness as hard as he could go.||
<page>
<img src="05DroppedTheWhiteKidGlovesAndTheFan.jpg" width="274" height="333" alt="Alice watches the White Rabbit run away"/>
Alice took#take# up the fan and gloves#glove#,|| and, as the hall was#be# very hot, she
kept#keep# fanning#fan# herself all the time she went#go# on talking#talk#:|| ‘Dear, dear! How
queer everything is#be# to-day! And yesterday things#thing# went#go# on just as usual.||
I wonder if I|’ve#have# been#be# changed#change# in the night? Let me think: was#be# I the
same when I @got up@#get up# this morning?|| I almost think I can remember feeling#feel# a
little different.|| But if I|’m#be# not the same, the next question is#be#, Who
in the world am#be# I?|| Ah, <i>that|’s#be#</i> the great puzzle!’|| And she began#begin# thinking#think#
over all the children#child# she knew#know# that were#be# of the same age as herself, to
see if she could have been#be# changed#change# for any of them.||

‘I|’m#be# sure I|’m#be# not Ada,’ she said#say#, ‘for her hair goes#go# in such long
ringlets#ringlet#, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets#ringlet# @at all@;|| and I|’m#be# sure I can’t
be Mabel, for I know all sorts#sort# of things#thing#, and she, oh! she knows#know# such a
very little!|| <page>Besides, <i>she|’s#be#</i> she, and I|’m#be# I, and--@oh dear@, how puzzling#puzzle#
it all is#be#!|| I|’ll#will# try if I know all the things#thing# I used#use# to know.|| Let me
see: four times#time# five is#be# twelve, and four times#time# six is#be# thirteen, and
four times#time# seven is#be#--@oh dear@! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!||
However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let|’s#us# try Geography.||
London is#be# the capital of Paris, and Paris is#be# the capital of Rome, and
Rome--no, <i>that|’s#be#</i> all wrong, I|’m#be# certain!|| I must have been#be# changed#change# for
Mabel!|| I|’ll#will# try and say “How doth the little--“’ and she crossed#cross# her
hands#hand# on her lap as if she were#be# saying#say# lessons#lesson#, and began#begin# to repeat it,||
but her voice sounded#sound# hoarse and strange, and the words#word# did#do# not come the
same as they used#use# to do:--||

     ‘How doth the little crocodile
      Improve his shining#shine# tail,
     And pour the waters#water# of the Nile
      On every golden scale!||

     ‘How cheerfully he seems#seem# to grin,
      How neatly spread his claws#claw#,
     And welcome little fishes#fish# in
      With gently smiling#smile# jaws#jaw#!’||<page>

‘I|’m#be# sure those are#be# not the right words#word#,’ said#say# poor Alice, and her eyes#eye#
filled#fill# with tears#tear# again as she went#go# on,|| ‘I must be Mabel @after all@, and
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys#toy# to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons#lesson# to learn!|| No, I|’ve#have#
made#make# up my mind about it; if I|’m#be# Mabel, I|’ll#will# stay down here!|| It|’ll#will# be no
use their putting#put# their heads#head# down and saying#say# “Come up again, dear!”|| I
shall only look up and say “Who am#be# I then? Tell me that first, and then,
if I like being#be# that person, I|’ll#will# come up: if not, I|’ll#will# stay down here
till I|’m#be# somebody else”||--but, @oh dear@!’ cried#cry# Alice, with a sudden burst
of tears#tear#, ‘I do wish they <i>would</i> put their heads#head# down! I am#be# so <i>very</i> tired#tire#
of being#be# all alone here!’||

As she said#say# this she looked#look# down at her hands#hand#, and was#be# surprised#surprise# to see
that she had#have# put on one of the Rabbit|’s little white kid gloves#glove# while
she was#be# talking#talk#.|| ‘How <i>can</i> I have done#do# that?’ she thought#think#. ‘I must
be growing#grow# small again.’|| She @got up@#get up# and went#go# to the table to measure
herself by it, and found#find# that, as nearly as she could guess, she was#be# now
about two feet#foot# high, and was#be# going#go# on shrinking#shrink# rapidly:||<page> she soon found#find#
out that the cause of this was#be# the fan she was#be# holding#hold#, and she dropped#drop#
it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking#shrink# away altogether.||

‘That <i>was#be#</i> a narrow escape!’ said#say# Alice, a good deal frightened#frighten# at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence;|| ‘and
now for the garden!’ and she ran#run# with all speed back to the little door:
but, alas! the little door was#be# shut again, and the little golden key was#be#
lying#lie# on the glass table as before,|| ‘and things#thing# are#be# worse#bad# than ever,’
thought#think# the poor child, ‘for I never was#be# so small as this before, never!||
And I declare it|’s#be# too bad, that it is#be#!’||

As she said#say# these words#word# her foot slipped#slip#, and in another moment, splash!
she was#be# up to her chin in salt water.|| Her first idea was#be# that she
had#have# somehow fallen#fall# into the sea, ‘and in that case I can go back by
railway,’ she said#say# to herself.|| (Alice had#have# been#be# to the seaside once in
her life, and had#have# come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing#bath# machines#machine# in the
sea, some children#child# digging#dig# in the sand with wooden spades#spade#, then a row
of lodging#lodge# houses#house#, and behind them a railway station.)||<page> However, she soon
made#make# out that she was#be# in the pool of tears#tear# which she had#have# wept#weep# when she
was#be# nine feet#foot# high.||
<img src="06ThePoolOfTears.jpg" width="252" height="204" alt="Alice swimming in the pool of tears"/>

‘I wish I hadn’t cried#cry# so much!’ said#say# Alice, as she swam#swim# about, trying#try#
to find her way out.|| ‘I shall be punished#punish# for it now, I suppose, by
being#be# drowned#drown# in my own tears#tear#!|| That <i>will</i> be a queer thing, to be sure!||
However, everything is#be# queer to-day.’||

Just then she heard#hear# something splashing#splash# about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam#swim# nearer#near# to make out what it was#be#:|| @at first@ she thought#think#
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered#remember# how small
she was#be# now, and she soon made#make# out that it was#be# only a mouse that had#have#
slipped#slip# in like herself.||

‘Would it be of any use, now,’ thought#think# Alice, ‘to speak to this mouse?||
Everything is#be# so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, there|’s#be# no harm in trying#try#.’|| So she
began#begin#: ‘O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am#be# very tired#tire#
of swimming#swim# about here, O Mouse!’|| (Alice thought#think# this must be the right
way of speaking#speak# to a mouse:|| she had#have# never done#do# such a thing before, but
she remembered#remember# having#have# seen#see# in her brother|’s Latin#latin# Grammar#grammar#, ‘A mouse--of
a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!’)||<page> The Mouse looked#look# at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed#seem# to her to wink with one of its little eyes#eye#,
but it said#say# nothing.||

‘Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,’ thought#think# Alice; ‘I daresay it|’s#be#
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.’|| (For, with all
her knowledge of history, Alice had#have# no very clear notion how long ago

was#be# the first sentence in her French lesson-#lesson#|book.|| The Mouse gave#give# a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed#seem# to quiver all over with fright.||
‘Oh, I @beg your pardon@#beg someone's pardon#!’ cried#cry# Alice hastily, afraid that she had#have# hurt
the poor animal|’s feelings#feeling#.|| ‘I quite forgot#forget# you didn’t like cats#cat#.’

‘Not like cats#cat#!’ cried#cry# the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. ‘Would
<i>you</i> like cats#cat# if you were#be# me?’||

<page>

‘Well, perhaps not,’ said#say# Alice in a soothing tone: ‘don’t be angry
about it.|| And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you|’d#would#
@take a fancy@ to cats#cat# if you could only see her.|| She is#be# such a dear quiet
thing,’ Alice went#go# on, half to herself, as she swam#swim# lazily about in the
pool,|| ‘and she sits#sit# purring#purr# so nicely by the fire, licking#lick# her paws#paw# and
washing#wash# her face--||and she is#be# such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she|’s#be#
such a capital one for catching#catch# mice#mouse#--oh, I @beg your pardon@#beg someone's pardon#!’ cried#cry#
Alice again,|| for this time the Mouse was#be# bristling#bristle# all over, and she
felt#feel# certain it must be really offended#offend#.|| ‘We won’t talk about her any
more if you|’d#would# rather not.’||

‘We indeed!’ cried#cry# the Mouse, who was#be# trembling#tremble# down to the end of his
tail.|| ‘As if I would talk on such a subject!|| Our family always <i>hated#hate#</i>
cats#cat#: nasty, low, vulgar things#thing#! Don’t let me hear the name again!’||

‘I won’t indeed!’ said#say# Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation.|| ‘Are#be# you--are#be# you fond--of--of dogs#dog#?’|| The Mouse did#do# not
answer, so Alice went#go# on eagerly: ‘There is#be# such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you!|| A little bright-#bright#|eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair!||<page> And it|’ll#will# fetch things#thing# when

of things#thing#--I can’t remember half of them--||and it belongs#belong# to a farmer,

says#say# it kills#kill# all the rats#rat#|| and--@oh dear@!’ cried#cry# Alice in a sorrowful
tone, ‘I|’m#be# afraid I|’ve#have# offended#offend# it again!’|| For the Mouse was#be# swimming#swim#
away from her as hard as it could go, and making#make# quite a commotion in
the pool as it went#go#.||

So she called#call# softly after it, ‘Mouse dear!|| Do come back again, and we
won’t talk about cats#cat# or dogs#dog# either, if you don’t like them!’|| When the
Mouse heard#hear# this, it turned#turn# round and swam#swim# slowly back to her:|| its
face was#be# quite pale (with passion, Alice thought#think#), and it said#say# in a low
trembling#tremble# voice, ‘Let us get to the shore, and then I|’ll#will# tell you my
history, and you|’ll#will# understand why it is#be# I hate cats#cat# and dogs#dog#.’||

It was#be# high time to go, for the pool was#be# getting#get# quite crowded#crowd# with the
birds#bird# and animals#animal# that had#have# fallen#fall# into it:|| there were#be# a Duck and a Dodo,
a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures#creature#.|| Alice led#lead# the
way, and the whole party swam#swim# to the shore.||<page>

<h2>CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale||</h2>

They were#be# indeed a queer-#queer#|looking#look# party that assembled#assemble# on the bank--||the
birds#bird# with draggled feathers#feather#, the animals#animal# with their fur clinging#cling# close
to them, and all dripping#drip# wet, cross, and uncomfortable.||

The first question @of course@ was#be#, how to get dry again:|| they had#have# a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes#minute# it seemed#seem# quite natural
to Alice to find herself talking#talk# familiarly with them, as if she had#have#
known#know# them all her life.|| Indeed, she had#have# quite a long argument with the
Lory, who at last turned#turn# sulky, and would only say, ‘I am#be# older#old# than
you, and must know better#good#’;|| and this Alice would not allow without
knowing#know# how old it was#be#, and, as the Lory positively refused#refuse# to tell its
age, there was#be# no more to be said#say#.||<page>

At last the Mouse, who seemed#seem# to be a person of authority among them,
called#call# out, ‘@Sit down@, all of you, and listen to me!|| <i>I’ll#will#</i> soon make you
dry enough!’ They all @sat down@#sit down# @at once@, in a large ring, with the Mouse
in the middle.|| Alice kept#keep# her eyes#eye# anxiously fixed#fix# on it, for she felt#feel#
sure she would catch a bad cold if she did#do# not get dry very soon.||

‘Ahem!’ said#say# the Mouse with an important air, ‘are#be# you all ready?|| This
is#be# the driest#dry# thing I know. Silence @all round@, if you please!|| “William
the Conqueror, whose cause was#be# favoured#favour# by the pope, was#be# soon submitted#submit#
to by the English, who wanted#want# leaders#leader#, and had#have# been#be# of late much
accustomed#accustom# to usurpation and conquest.|| Edwin and Morcar, the earls#earl# of
Mercia and Northumbria--”’||

‘Ugh!’ said#say# the Lory, with a shiver.||

‘I @beg your pardon@#beg someone's pardon#!’ said#say# the Mouse, frowning#frown#, but very politely: ‘Did#do#
you speak?’

‘Not I!’ said#say# the Lory hastily.||

‘I thought#think# you did#do#,’ said#say# the Mouse. ‘--I proceed.||<page> “Edwin and Morcar,
the earls#earl# of Mercia and Northumbria, declared#declare# for him:|| and even Stigand,
the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found#find# it advisable--”’

‘Found#find# <i>what</i>?’ said#say# the Duck.||

‘Found#find# <i>it</i>,’ the Mouse replied#reply# rather crossly: ‘@of course@ you know what
“it” means#mean#.’||

‘I know what “it” means#mean# well enough, when I find a thing,’ said#say# the
Duck: ‘it|’s#be# generally a frog or a worm.|| The question is#be#, what did#do# the
archbishop find?’||

The Mouse did#do# not notice this question, but hurriedly went#go# on, ‘“--found#find#
it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the
crown.|| William|’s conduct @at first@ was#be# moderate. But the insolence of his
Normans--” How are#be# you @getting on@#get on# now, my dear?’ it continued#continue#, turning#turn#
to Alice as it spoke#speak#.||

‘As wet as ever,’ said#say# Alice in a melancholy tone: ‘it doesn’t seem to
dry me @at all@.’||

‘In that case,’ said#say# the Dodo solemnly, rising#rise# to its feet#foot#, ‘I move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies#remedy#--’||<page>

‘Speak English!’ said#say# the Eaglet. ‘I don’t know the meaning of half
those long words#word#, and, what|’s#be# more, I don’t believe you do either!’|| And
the Eaglet bent#bend# down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds#bird#
tittered#titter# audibly.||

‘What I was#be# going#go# to say,’ said#say# the Dodo in an offended#offend# tone, ‘was#be#, that
the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.’||

‘What <i>is#be#</i> a Caucus-race?’ said#say# Alice; not that she wanted#want# much to know,
but the Dodo had#have# paused#pause# as if it thought#think# that <i>somebody</i> ought to speak,
and no one else seemed#seem# inclined to say anything.||

‘Why,’ said#say# the Dodo, ‘the best way to explain it is#be# to do it.’ (And, as
you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell
you how the Dodo managed#manage# it.)||

First it marked#mark# out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (‘the exact
shape doesn’t matter,’ it said#say#,) and then all the party were#be# placed#place#
along the course, here and there.|| There was#be# no ‘One, two, three, and
away,’ but they began#begin# running#run# when they liked#like#, and @left off@#leave off# when they
liked#like#, so that it was#be# not easy to know when the race was#be# over.||<page> However,
when they had#have# been#be# running#run# half an hour or so, and were#be# quite dry again,
the Dodo suddenly called#call# out ‘The race is#be# over!’ and they all crowded#crowd#
round it, panting#pant#, and asking#ask#, ‘But who has#have# won#win#?’||

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,
and it sat#sit# for a long time with one finger pressed#press# upon its forehead
(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures#picture#
of him), while the rest waited#wait# in silence.|| At last the Dodo said#say#,
‘<i>everybody</i> has#have# won#win#, and all must have prizes#prize#.’||

‘But who is#be# to give the prizes#prize#?’ quite a chorus of voices#voice# asked#ask#.||

‘Why, <i>she</i>, @of course@,’ said#say# the Dodo, pointing#point# to Alice with one finger;
and the whole party @at once@ crowded#crowd# round her, calling#call# out in a confused#confuse#
way, ‘Prizes#prize#! Prizes#prize#!’||

Alice had#have# no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled#pull# out a box of comfits#comfit#, (luckily the salt water had#have#
not got#get# into it), and handed#hand# them round as prizes#prize#.|| There was#be# exactly one
a-piece @all round@.||<page>

‘But she must have a prize herself, you know,’ said#say# the Mouse.||

‘@Of course@,’ the Dodo replied#reply# very gravely. ‘What else have you got#get# in
your pocket?’ he went#go# on, turning#turn# to Alice.||

‘Only a thimble,’ said#say# Alice sadly.||

‘Hand it over here,’ said#say# the Dodo.||

Then they all crowded#crowd# round her @once more@, while the Dodo solemnly
presented#present# the thimble, saying#say# ‘We beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble’; and, when it had#have# finished#finish# this short speech, they all cheered#cheer#.||
<img src="08ThisElegantThimble.jpg" width="270" height="306" alt="The Dodo gives Alice the thimble"/>

Alice thought#think# the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked#look# so grave
that she did#do# not dare to laugh;|| and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed#bow#, and took#take# the thimble, looking#look# as solemn as she
could.||

The next thing was#be# to eat the comfits#comfit#: this caused#cause# some noise and
confusion, as the large birds#bird# complained#complain# that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones#one# choked#choke# and had#have# to be patted#pat# on the back.||
However, it was#be# over at last, and they @sat down@#sit down# again in a ring, and
begged#beg# the Mouse to tell them something more.||<page>

‘You promised#promise# to tell me your history, you know,’ said#say# Alice, ‘and why
it is#be# you hate--C and D,’ she added#add# in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended#offend# again.||

‘Mine is#be# a long and a sad tale!’ said#say# the Mouse, turning#turn# to Alice, and
sighing#sigh#.||

‘It <i>is#be#</i> a long tail, certainly,’ said#say# Alice, looking#look# down with wonder at
the Mouse|’s tail; ‘but why do you call it sad?’|| And she kept#keep# on puzzling#puzzle#
about it while the Mouse was#be# speaking#speak#, so that her idea of the tale was#be#
something like this:--||<page>

         ‘Fury said#say# to a
         mouse, That he
        met#meet# in the
       house,
     “Let us
      both go to
       law: <i>I</i> will
        prosecute
         <i>you</i>.||--Come,
           I|’ll#will# take no
           denial; We
          must have a
        trial: For
      really this
     morning I|’ve#have#
    nothing
    to do.”||
      Said#say# the
      mouse to the
       cur, “Such
        a trial,
         dear Sir,
            With
          no jury

       would be

      our

        “I|’ll#will# be

             Said#say#
         cunning
          old Fury:
          “I|’ll#will#
          try the

              and
           condemn
           you
          to
           death.”’||<page>


‘You are#be# not attending#attend#!’ said#say# the Mouse to Alice severely. ‘What are#be# you
thinking#think# of?’||
<img src="09TheMousesTale.jpg" width="268" height="204" alt="The Mouse tells his tale"/>

‘I @beg your pardon@#beg someone's pardon#,’ said#say# Alice very humbly: ‘you had#have# got#get# to the fifth
bend, I think?’||

‘I had#have# <i>not</i>!’ cried#cry# the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.||

‘A knot!’ said#say# Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking#look#
anxiously about her.|| ‘Oh, do let me help to undo it!’||

‘I shall do nothing of the sort,’ said#say# the Mouse, @getting up@#get up# and walking#walk#
away.|| ‘You insult me by talking#talk# such nonsense!’||

‘I didn’t mean it!’ pleaded#plead# poor Alice.|| ‘But you|’re#be# so easily offended#offend#,
you know!’||

The Mouse only growled#growl# in reply.||

‘Please come back and finish your story!’ Alice called#call# after it; and the
others all joined#join# in chorus, ‘Yes, please do!’ but the Mouse only shook#shake#
its head impatiently, and walked#walk# a little quicker.||

‘What a pity it wouldn’t stay!’ sighed#sigh# the Lory, as soon as it was#be# quite
out of sight;|| and an old Crab#crab# took#take# the opportunity of saying#say# to her
daughter ‘Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to @lose
<i>your</i> temper@#lose one's temper#!’||<page> ‘Hold your tongue, Ma#ma#!’ said#say# the young Crab#crab#, a little
snappishly. ‘You’re#be# enough to try the patience of an oyster!’||

‘I wish I had#have# our Dinah here, I know I do!’ said#say# Alice aloud, addressing#address#
nobody in particular. ‘She|’d#would# soon fetch it back!’||

‘And who is#be# Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?’ said#say# the
Lory.||

Alice replied#reply# eagerly, for she was#be# always ready to talk about her pet:
‘Dinah|’s#be# our cat.|| And she|’s#be# such a capital one for catching#catch# mice#mouse# you
can’t think!|| And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds#bird#! Why,
she|’ll#will# eat a little bird as soon as look at it!’||

This speech caused#cause# a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
birds#bird# hurried#hurry# off @at once@:|| one old Magpie began#begin# wrapping#wrap# itself up very
carefully, remarking#remark#, ‘I really must be getting#get# home; the night-|air
doesn’t suit my throat!’|| and a Canary called#call# out in a trembling#tremble# voice to
its children#child#, ‘Come away, my dears#dear#! It|’s#be# high time you were#be# all in bed!’||
On various pretexts#pretext# they all moved#move# off, and Alice was#be# soon left#leave# alone.||<page>

‘I wish I hadn’t mentioned#mention# Dinah!’ she said#say# to herself in a melancholy
tone.|| ‘Nobody seems#seem# to like her, down here, and I|’m#be# sure she|’s#be# the best
cat in the world!|| Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
any more!’|| And here poor Alice began#begin# to cry again, for she felt#feel# very
lonely and low-spirited.|| In a little while, however, she again heard#hear#
a little pattering of footsteps#footstep# in the distance,|| and she looked#look# up
eagerly, half hoping#hope# that the Mouse had#have# changed#change# his mind, and was#be# coming#come#
back to finish his story.||<page>

<h2>CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends#send# in a Little Bill||</h2>

It was#be# the White Rabbit, trotting#trot# slowly back again, and looking#look#
anxiously about as it went#go#, as if it had#have# lost#lose# something;|| and she heard#hear#
it muttering#mutter# to itself ‘The Duchess!|| The Duchess! Oh my dear paws#paw#! Oh
my fur and whiskers#whisker#!|| She|’ll#will# get me executed#execute#, as sure as ferrets#ferret# are#be#
ferrets#ferret#!|| Where <i>can</i> I have dropped#drop# them, I wonder?’|| Alice guessed#guess# in a
moment that it was#be# looking#look# for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves#glove#,
and she very good-naturedly began#begin# hunting#hunt# about for them, but they were#be#
nowhere to be seen#see#--||everything seemed#seem# to have changed#change# since her swim in
the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,
had#have# vanished#vanish# completely.||

Very soon the Rabbit noticed#notice# Alice, as she went#go# hunting#hunt# about, and
called#call# out to her in an angry tone, ‘Why, Mary Ann, what <i>are#be#</i> you doing#do#
out here?||<page> Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves#glove# and a fan!
Quick, now!’|| And Alice was#be# so much frightened#frighten# that she ran#run# off @at once@
in the direction it pointed#point# to, without trying#try# to explain the mistake it
had#have# made#make#.||

‘He took#take# me for his housemaid,’ she said#say# to herself as she ran#run#.|| ‘How
surprised#surprise# he|’ll#will# be when he finds#find# out who I am#be#!|| But I|’d#would# better#good# take him
his fan and gloves#glove#--that is#be#, if I can find them.’|| As she said#say# this, she
came#come# upon a neat little house, on the door of which was#be# a bright brass
plate with the name ‘W#w#. RABBIT#rabbit#’ engraved#engrave# upon it.|| She went#go# in without
knocking, and hurried#hurry# upstairs, in great fear lest#lest# she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned#turn# out of the house before she had#have# found#find# the
fan and gloves#glove#.||

‘How queer it seems#seem#,’ Alice said#say# to herself, ‘to be going#go# messages#message# for
a rabbit!|| I suppose Dinah|’ll#will# be sending#send# me on messages#message# next!’|| And she
began#begin# fancying#fancy# the sort of thing that would happen: ‘“Miss Alice! Come
here directly, and get ready for your walk!”||<page> “Coming#come# in a minute,
nurse! But I|’ve#have# got#get# to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.”|| Only I don’t
think,’ Alice went#go# on, ‘that they|’d#would# let Dinah stop in the house if it
began#begin# ordering#order# people about like that!’||

By this time she had#have# found#find# her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had#have# hoped#hope#) a fan and two or three pairs#pair#
of tiny white kid gloves#glove#:|| she took#take# up the fan and a pair of the gloves#glove#,
and was#be# just going#go# to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little
bottle that stood#stand# near the looking-glass.|| There was#be# no label this time
with the words#word# ‘DRINK#drink# ME#me#,’ but nevertheless she uncorked#uncork# it and put it
to her lips#lip#.|| ‘I know <i>something</i> interesting is#be# sure to happen,’ she said#say#
to herself, ‘whenever I eat or drink anything; so I|’ll#will# just see what
this bottle does#do#.|| I do hope it|’ll#will# make me grow large again, for really
I|’m#be# quite tired#tire# of being#be# such a tiny little thing!’||

It did#do# so indeed, and much sooner than she had#have# expected#expect#:|| before she had#have#
drunk#drink# half the bottle, she found#find# her head pressing#press# against the ceiling,
and had#have# to stoop to save her neck from being#be# broken#break#.|| She hastily put
down the bottle, saying#say# to herself ‘That|’s#be# quite enough--I hope I shan’t
grow any more--||As it is#be#, I can’t get out at the door--I do wish I hadn’t
drunk#drink# quite so much!’||
<img src="10CantGetOutAtTheDoor.jpg" width="264" height="187" alt="Alice is stuck in the White Rabbit's house"/>
<page>

Alas!|| it was#be# too late to wish that! She went#go# on growing#grow#, and growing#grow#,
and very soon had#have# to kneel down on the floor:|| in another minute there
was#be# not even room for this, and she tried#try# the effect of lying#lie# down with
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled#curl# round her head.||
Still she went#go# on growing#grow#,|| and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said#say# to herself ‘Now I
can do no more, whatever happens#happen#. What <i>will</i> become of me?’||

Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had#have# now had#have# its full effect,
and she grew#grow# no larger#large#:|| still it was#be# very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed#seem# to be no sort of chance of her ever getting#get# out of the room
again, no wonder she felt#feel# unhappy.||

‘It was#be# much pleasanter#pleasant# at home,’ thought#think# poor Alice, ‘when one wasn’t
always growing#grow# larger#large# and smaller#small#, and being#be# ordered#order# about by mice#mouse# and
rabbits#rabbit#.||<page> I almost wish I hadn’t gone#go# down that rabbit-#rabbit#|hole--and yet--and
yet--it|’s#be# rather curious, you know, this sort of life!|| I do wonder what
<i>can</i> have happened#happen# to me!|| When I used#use# to read fairy-tales, I fancied#fancy# that
kind of thing never happened#happen#, and now here I am#be# in the middle of one!||
There ought to be a book written#write# about me, that there ought!|| And when I
@grow up@, I|’ll#will# write one--but I|’m#be# @grown up@#grow up# now,’ she added#add# in a sorrowful
tone; ‘at least there|’s#be# no room to @grow up@ any more <i>here</i>.’||

‘But then,’ thought#think# Alice, ‘shall I <i>never</i> get any older#old# than I am#be#
now?|| That|’ll#will# be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but
then--always to have lessons#lesson# to learn!|| Oh, I shouldn’t like <i>that</i>!’||

‘Oh, you foolish Alice!’ she answered#answer# herself.|| ‘How can you learn
lessons#lesson# in here?|| Why, there|’s#be# hardly room for <i>you</i>, and no room @at all@
for any lesson-#lesson#|books#book#!’||

And so she went#go# on, taking#take# first one side and then the other, and making#make#
quite a conversation of it altogether;|| but after a few minutes#minute# she heard#hear#
a voice outside, and stopped#stop# to listen.||

‘Mary Ann! Mary Ann!’ said#say# the voice. ‘Fetch#fetch# me my gloves#glove# this moment!’||<page>
Then came#come# a little pattering of feet#foot# on the stairs#stair#.|| Alice knew#know# it was#be#
the Rabbit coming#come# to look for her,|| and she trembled#tremble# till she shook#shake# the
house, quite forgetting#forget# that she was#be# now about a thousand times#time# as large
as the Rabbit, and had#have# no reason to be afraid of it.||

Presently the Rabbit came#come# up to the door, and tried#try# to open it;|| but, as
the door opened#open# inwards, and Alice|’s elbow was#be# pressed#press# hard against it,
that attempt proved#prove# a failure.|| Alice heard#hear# it say to itself ‘Then I|’ll#will#
go round and get in at the window.’||

‘<i>That</i> you won’t’ thought#think# Alice, and, after waiting#wait# till she fancied#fancy#
she heard#hear# the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand, and made#make# a snatch in the air.|| She did#do# not get hold of anything,
but she heard#hear# a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken#break# glass,
from which she concluded#conclude# that it was#be# just possible it had#have# fallen#fall# into a
cucumber-#cucumber#|frame, or something of the sort.||
<img src="11FallenIntoACucumberFrame.jpg" width="200" height="286" alt="The White Rabbit falls into the cucumber frame"/>

Next came#come# an angry voice--the Rabbit|’s--‘Pat#pat#! Pat#pat#! Where are#be# you?’|| And
then a voice she had#have# never heard#hear# before, ‘Sure#sure# then I|’m#be# here! Digging#dig#
for apples#apple#, yer honour!’||<page>

‘Digging#dig# for apples#apple#, indeed!’ said#say# the Rabbit angrily.|| ‘Here! Come and
help me out of <i>this</i>!’ (Sounds#sound# of more broken#break# glass.)||

‘Now tell me, Pat#pat#, what|’s#be# that in the window?’||

‘Sure, it|’s#be# an arm, yer honour!’ (He pronounced#pronounce# it ‘arrum.’)||

‘An arm, you goose! Who ever saw#see# one that size? Why, it fills#fill# the whole
window!’||

‘Sure, it does#do#, yer honour: but it|’s#be# an arm for all that.’||

‘Well, it|’s#be# got#get# no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!’||

There was#be# a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers#whisper#
now and then;|| such as, ‘Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, @at all@, at
all!’ ‘Do as I tell you, you coward!’ and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made#make# another snatch in the air.|| This time there were#be#
<i>two</i> little shrieks#shriek#, and more sounds#sound# of broken#break# glass.|| ‘What a number of
cucumber-#cucumber#|frames#frame# there must be!’ thought#think# Alice.|| ‘I wonder what they|’ll#will# do
next!|| As for pulling#pull# me out of the window, I only wish they <i>could</i>!|| I|’m#be#
sure I don’t want to stay in here any longer#long#!’||<page>

She waited#wait# for some time without hearing#hear# anything more:|| at last came#come# a
rumbling of little cartwheels#cartwheel#, and the sound of a good many voices#voice#
all talking#talk# together:|| she made#make# out the words#word#: ‘Where|’s#be# the other
ladder?--||Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill|’s#be# got#get# the other--||Bill!
fetch it here, lad!--||Here, put ‘em up at this corner--No, tie ‘em
together first--they don’t reach half high enough yet--||Oh! they|’ll#will#
do well enough; don’t be particular--||Here, Bill! catch hold of this
rope--||Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--||Oh, it|’s#be# coming#come#
down!|| Heads#head# below!’ (a loud crash)--||‘Now, who did#do# that?--It was#be# Bill, I
fancy--||Who|’s#be# to go down the chimney?--Nay#nay#, I shan’t!|| <i>You</i> do it!--That I
won’t, then!--||Bill|’s#be# to go down--||Here, Bill! the master says#say# you|’re#be# to
go down the chimney!’||

‘Oh! So Bill|’s#have# got#get# to come down the chimney, has#have# he?’ said#say# Alice to
herself.|| ‘Shy#shy#, they seem to put everything upon Bill!|| I wouldn’t be in
Bill|’s place for a good deal:|| this fireplace is#be# narrow, to be sure; but
I <i>think</i> I can kick a little!’||<page>

She drew#draw# her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited#wait#
till she heard#hear# a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was#be#)
scratching and scrambling#scramble# about in the chimney close above her:|| then,
saying#say# to herself ‘This is#be# Bill,’ she gave#give# one sharp kick, and waited#wait# to
see what would happen next.||
<img src="12ThereGoesBill.jpg" width="150" height="400" alt="Bill flies out of the chimney"/>

The first thing she heard#hear# was#be# a general chorus of ‘There goes#go# Bill!’||
then the Rabbit|’s voice along--‘Catch#catch# him, you by the hedge!’|| then
silence, and then another confusion of voices#voice#--||‘Hold up his head--Brandy
now--Don’t choke him--How was#be# it, old fellow?|| What happened#happen# to you? Tell#tell#
us all about it!’||

Last came#come# a little feeble, squeaking voice,|| (‘That|’s#be# Bill,’ thought#think#
Alice,)|| ‘Well, I hardly know--||No more, thank ye; I|’m#be# better#good# now--||but I|’m#be#
a deal too flustered#fluster# to tell you--||all I know is#be#, something comes#come# at me
like a Jack-in-the-box#jack-in-the-box#, and up I goes#go# like a sky-#sky#|rocket!’||

‘So you did#do#, old fellow!’ said#say# the others.||

‘We must burn the house down!’ said#say# the Rabbit|’s voice;|| and Alice called#call#
out as loud as she could, ‘If you do.|| I|’ll#will# set Dinah at you!’||<page>

There was#be# a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought#think# to herself, ‘I
wonder what they <i>will</i> do next!|| If they had#have# any sense, they|’d#would# take the
roof off.’|| After a minute or two, they began#begin# moving#move# about again, and
Alice heard#hear# the Rabbit say, ‘A barrowful will do, to begin with.’||

‘A barrowful of <i>what</i>?’ thought#think# Alice;|| but she had#have# not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles#pebble# came#come# rattling#rattle# in at the
window, and some of them hit her in the face.|| ‘I|’ll#will# put a stop to this,’
she said#say# to herself, and shouted#shout# out, ‘You|’d#would# better#good# not do that again!’
which produced#produce# another dead silence.||

Alice noticed#notice# with some surprise that the pebbles#pebble# were#be# all @turning into@#turn into#
little cakes#cake# as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came#come# into her
head.|| ‘If I eat one of these cakes#cake#,’ she thought#think#, ‘it|’s#be# sure to make
<i>some</i> change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger#large#, it must
make me smaller#small#, I suppose.’||<page>

So she swallowed#swallow# one of the cakes#cake#, and was#be# delighted#delight# to find that she
began#begin# shrinking#shrink# directly.|| As soon as she was#be# small enough to get through
the door, she ran#run# out of the house, and found#find# quite a crowd of little
animals#animal# and birds#bird# waiting#wait# outside.|| The poor little Lizard#lizard#, Bill, was#be#
in the middle, being#be# held#hold# up by two guinea-pigs#guinea-pig#, who were#be# giving#give# it
something out of a bottle.|| They all made#make# a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared#appear#;|| but she ran#run# off as hard as she could, and soon found#find# herself
safe in a thick wood.||

‘The first thing I|’ve#have# got#get# to do,’ said#say# Alice to herself, as she wandered#wander#
about in the wood, ‘is#be# to grow to my right size again;|| and the second
thing is#be# to find my way into that lovely garden.|| I think that will be
the best plan.’

It sounded#sound# an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged#arrange#; the only difficulty was#be#, that she had#have# not the smallest#small# idea
how to set about it;|| and while she was#be# peering#peer# about anxiously among
the trees#tree#, a little sharp bark just over her head made#make# her look up in a
great hurry.||<page>

An enormous puppy was#be# looking#look# down at her with large round eyes#eye#, and
feebly stretching#stretch# out one paw, trying#try# to touch her.|| ‘Poor#poor# little thing!’
said#say# Alice, in a coaxing#coax# tone, and she tried#try# hard to whistle to it;|| but
she was#be# terribly frightened#frighten# all the time at the thought that it might be
hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of
all her coaxing#coax#.||
<img src="13AnEnormousPuppy.jpg" width="267" height="318" alt="The enormous puppy wants to play with Alice"/>

Hardly knowing#know# what she did#do#, she picked#pick# up a little bit of stick, and
held#hold# it out to the puppy;|| whereupon the puppy jumped#jump# into the air off
all its feet#foot# @at once@, with a yelp of delight, and rushed#rush# at the stick,
and made#make# believe to worry it;|| then Alice dodged#dodge# behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being#be# run over;|| and the moment she appeared#appear# on the
other side, the puppy made#make# another rush at the stick, and tumbled#tumble# head
over heels#heel# in its hurry to get hold of it;|| then Alice, thinking#think# it was#be#
very like having#have# a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting#expect# every
moment to be trampled#trample# under its feet#foot#, ran#run# round the thistle again;|| then
the puppy began#begin# a series of short charges#charge# at the stick, running#run# a very
little way forwards#forward# each time and a long way back, and barking#bark# hoarsely
all the while,|| till at last it @sat down@#sit down# a good way off, panting#pant#, with
its tongue hanging#hang# out of its mouth, and its great eyes#eye# half shut.||<page>

This seemed#seem# to Alice a good opportunity for making#make# her escape;|| so she
set off @at once@, and ran#run# till she was#be# quite tired#tire# and out of breath, and
till the puppy|’s bark sounded#sound# quite faint in the distance.||

‘And yet what a dear little puppy it was#be#!’ said#say# Alice, as she leant#lean#
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned#fan# herself with one of the
leaves#leaf#:|| ‘I should have liked#like# teaching#teach# it tricks#trick# very much, if--if I|’d#would#
only been#be# the right size to do it!|| Oh dear! I|’d#had# nearly forgotten#forget# that
I|’ve#have# got#get# to @grow up@ again!|| Let me see--how <i>is#be#</i> it to be managed#manage#?|| I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is#be#, what?’||

The great question certainly was#be#, what?|| Alice looked#look# all round her at
the flowers#flower# and the blades#blade# of grass, but she did#do# not see anything that
looked#look# like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances#circumstance#.||
There was#be# a large mushroom growing#grow# near her, about the same height as
herself;||<page> and when she had#have# looked#look# under it, and on both sides#side# of it, and
behind it, it occurred#occur# to her that she might as well look and see what
was#be# on the top of it.||

She stretched#stretch# herself up on tiptoe, and peeped#peep# over the edge of the
mushroom,|| and her eyes#eye# immediately met#meet# those of a large caterpillar,
that was#be# sitting#sit# on the top with its arms#arm# folded#fold#, quietly smoking#smoke# a long
hookah, and taking#take# not the smallest#small# notice of her or of anything else.||<page>

<h2>CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar||</h2>

The Caterpillar and Alice looked#look# at each other for some time in silence:||
at last the Caterpillar took#take# the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed#address#
her in a languid, sleepy voice.||
<img src="14WhoAreYouSaidTheCaterpillar.jpg" width="255" height="344" alt="The Caterpillar smoking on the mushroom"/>

‘Who are#be# <i>you</i>?’ said#say# the Caterpillar.||

This was#be# not an encouraging opening for a conversation.|| Alice replied#reply#,
rather shyly, ‘I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--||at least I know
who I <i>was#be#</i> when I @got up@#get up# this morning, but I think I must have been#be#
changed#change# several times#time# since then.’||

‘What do you mean by that?’ said#say# the Caterpillar sternly. ‘Explain#explain#
yourself!’||

‘I can’t explain <i>myself</i>, I|’m#be# afraid, sir’ said#say# Alice, ‘because I|’m#be# not
myself, you see.’||

‘I don’t see,’ said#say# the Caterpillar.||

‘I|’m#be# afraid I can’t put it more clearly,’ Alice replied#reply# very politely,
‘for I can’t understand it myself to begin with;|| and being#be# so many
different sizes#size# in a day is#be# very confusing.’||<page>

‘It isn’t,’ said#say# the Caterpillar.||

‘Well, perhaps you haven’t found#find# it so yet,’ said#say# Alice;|| ‘but when you
have to @turn into@ a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then
after that into a butterfly, I should think you|’ll#will# feel it a little
queer, won’t you?’||

‘Not a bit,’ said#say# the Caterpillar.||

‘Well, perhaps your feelings#feeling# may be different,’ said#say# Alice;|| ‘all I know
is#be#, it would feel very queer to <i>me</i>.’||

‘You!’ said#say# the Caterpillar contemptuously. ‘Who are#be# <i>you</i>?’||

Which brought#bring# them back again to the beginning of the conversation.||
Alice felt#feel# a little irritated at the Caterpillar|’s making#make# such <i>very</i>
short remarks#remark#,|| and she drew#draw# herself up and said#say#, very gravely, ‘I think,
you ought to tell me who <i>you</i> are#be#, first.’||

‘Why?’ said#say# the Caterpillar.||

Here was#be# another puzzling#puzzle# question;|| and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed#seem# to be in a <i>very</i> unpleasant
state of mind, she turned#turn# away.||<page>

‘Come back!’ the Caterpillar called#call# after her. ‘I|’ve#have# something important
to say!’||

This sounded#sound# promising, certainly: Alice turned#turn# and came#come# back again.||

‘@Keep your temper@#keep one's temper#,’ said#say# the Caterpillar.||

‘Is#be# that all?’ said#say# Alice, swallowing#swallow# down her anger as well as she
could.||

‘No,’ said#say# the Caterpillar.||

Alice thought#think# she might as well wait, as she had#have# nothing else to do, and
perhaps @after all@ it might tell her something worth hearing#hear#.|| For some
minutes#minute# it puffed#puff# away without speaking#speak#,|| but at last it unfolded#unfold# its
arms#arm#, took#take# the hookah out of its mouth again, and said#say#, ‘So you think
you|’re#be# changed#change#, do you?’||

‘I|’m#be# afraid I am#be#, sir,’ said#say# Alice;|| ‘I can’t remember things#thing# as I
used#use#--and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes#minute# together!’||

‘Can’t remember <i>what</i> things#thing#?’ said#say# the Caterpillar.||

‘Well, I|’ve#have# tried#try# to say “<i>How doth the little busy bee</i>,” but it all came#come#
different!’ Alice replied#reply# in a very melancholy voice.||<page>

‘Repeat, “<i>You are#be# old, Father William</i>,”’ said#say# the Caterpillar.||

Alice folded#fold# her hands#hand#, and began#begin#:--||

   ‘You are#be# old, Father#father# William,’ the young man said#say#,
    ‘And your hair has#have# become very white;||
   And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
    Do you think, at your age, it is#be# right?’||
<img src="15YouIncessantlyStandOnYourHead.jpg" width="267" height="200" alt="Father William standing on his head"/>

   ‘In my youth,’ Father#father# William replied#reply# to his son,
    ‘I feared#fear# it might injure the brain;||
   But, now that I|’m#be# perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.’||

   ‘You are#be# old,’ said#say# the youth, ‘as I mentioned#mention# before,
    And have grown#grow# most uncommonly fat;||
   Yet you turned#turn# a back-somersault in at the door--
    Pray, what is#be# the reason of that?’||
<img src="16TurnedABackSomersaultInAtTheDoor.jpg" width="270" height="204" alt="Father William turning a somersault"/>

   ‘In my youth,’ said#say# the sage, as he shook#shake# his grey locks#lock#,
    ‘I kept#keep# all my limbs#limb# very supple||
   By the use of this ointment--one shilling#shill# the box--
    Allow me to sell you a couple?’||<page>

   ‘You are#be# old,’ said#say# the youth, ‘and your jaws#jaw# are#be# too weak
    For anything tougher#tough# than suet;||
   Yet you finished#finish# the goose, with the bones#bone# and the beak--
    Pray how did#do# you manage to do it?’||
<img src="17AGooseWithTheBonesAndTheBeak.jpg" width="268" height="204" alt="Father William has eaten the whole goose"/>

   ‘In my youth,’ said#say# his father, ‘I took#take# to the law,
    And argued#argue# each case with my wife;||
   And the muscular strength, which it gave#give# to my jaw,
    Has#have# lasted#last# the rest of my life.’||

   ‘You are#be# old,’ said#say# the youth, ‘one would hardly suppose
    That your eye was#be# as steady as ever;||
   Yet you balanced#balance# an eel on the end of your nose--
    What made#make# you so awfully clever?’||
<img src="18BalanceAnEelOnTheEndOfYourNose.jpg" width="271" height="204" alt="Father William balancing an eel on his nose"/>

   ‘I have answered#answer# three questions#question#, and that is#be# enough,’
    Said#say# his father; ‘don’t give yourself airs!||
   Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or I|’ll#will# kick you down stairs#stair#!’||


‘That is#be# not said#say# right,’ said#say# the Caterpillar.||

‘Not <i>quite</i> right, I|’m#be# afraid,’ said#say# Alice, timidly; ‘some of the words#word#
have got#get# altered.’||<page>

‘It is#be# wrong from beginning#begin# to end,’ said#say# the Caterpillar decidedly, and
there was#be# silence for some minutes#minute#.||

The Caterpillar was#be# the first to speak.||

‘What size do you want to be?’ it asked#ask#.||

‘Oh, I|’m#be# not particular as to size,’ Alice hastily replied#reply#; ‘only one
doesn’t like changing#change# so often, you know.’||

‘I <i>don’t</i> know,’ said#say# the Caterpillar.||

Alice said#say# nothing: she had#have# never been#be# so much contradicted#contradict# in her life
before, and she felt#feel# that she was#be# @losing her temper@#lose one's temper#.||

‘Are#be# you content now?’ said#say# the Caterpillar.||

‘Well, I should like to be a <i>little</i> larger#large#, sir, if you wouldn’t mind,’
said#say# Alice: ‘three inches#inch# is#be# such a wretched height to be.’||

‘It is#be# a very good height indeed!’ said#say# the Caterpillar angrily, rearing#rear#
itself upright as it spoke#speak#|| (it was#be# exactly three inches#inch# high).||

‘But I|’m#be# not used#use# to it!’ pleaded#plead# poor Alice in a piteous tone.|| And
she thought#think# of herself, ‘I wish the creatures#creature# wouldn’t be so easily
offended#offend#!’||<page>

‘You|’ll#will# @get used to@ it in time,’ said#say# the Caterpillar;|| and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began#begin# smoking#smoke# again.||

This time Alice waited#wait# patiently until it chose#choose# to speak again.|| In
a minute or two the Caterpillar took#take# the hookah out of its mouth
and yawned#yawn# once or twice, and shook#shake# itself.|| Then it got#get# down off the
mushroom, and crawled#crawl# away in the grass, merely remarking#remark# as it went#go#,
‘One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter#short#.’||

‘One side of <i>what</i>? The other side of <i>what</i>?’ thought#think# Alice to herself.||

‘Of the mushroom,’ said#say# the Caterpillar, just as if she had#have# asked#ask# it
aloud;|| and in another moment it was#be# out of sight.||

Alice remained#remain# looking#look# thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying#try#
to make out which were#be# the two sides#side# of it; and as it was#be# perfectly
round, she found#find# this a very difficult question.|| However, at last she
stretched#stretch# her arms#arm# round it as far as they would go, and broke#break# off a bit
of the edge with each hand.||

‘And now which is#be# which?’ she said#say# to herself, and nibbled#nibble# a little of
the right-hand#righthand# bit to try the effect:|| the next moment she felt#feel# a violent
blow underneath her chin: it had#have# struck#strike# her foot!||<page>

She was#be# a good deal frightened#frighten# by this very sudden change, but she felt#feel#
that there was#be# no time to be lost#lose#, as she was#be# shrinking#shrink# rapidly;|| so she
set to work @at once@ to eat some of the other bit.|| Her chin was#be# pressed#press#
so closely against her foot, that there was#be# hardly room to open her
mouth;|| but she did#do# it at last, and managed#manage# to swallow a morsel of the
lefthand bit.||

||<page>‘Come, my head|’s#be# free at last!’ said#say# Alice in a tone of delight, which
changed#change# into alarm in another moment, when she found#find# that her shoulders#shoulder#
were#be# nowhere to be found#find#:|| all she could see, when she looked#look# down, was#be#
an immense length of neck, which seemed#seem# to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves#leaf# that lay far below her.||

‘What <i>can</i> all that green stuff be?’ said#say# Alice.|| ‘And where <i>have</i> my
shoulders#shoulder# got#get# to?|| And oh, my poor hands#hand#, how is#be# it I can’t see you?’||
She was#be# moving#move# them about as she spoke#speak#, but no result seemed#seem# to follow,
except a little shaking#shake# among the distant green leaves#leaf#.||

As there seemed#seem# to be no chance of getting#get# her hands#hand# up to her head, she
tried#try# to get her head down to them,|| and was#be# delighted#delight# to find that her
neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.|| She had#have#
just succeeded#succeed# in curving#curve# it down into a graceful zigzag, and was#be# going#go#
to dive in among the leaves#leaf#, which she found#find# to be nothing but the tops#top#
of the trees#tree# under which she had#have# been#be# wandering#wander#, when a sharp hiss made#make#
her draw back in a hurry:|| a large pigeon had#have# flown#fly# into her face, and
was#be# beating#beat# her violently with its wings#wing#.||<page>

‘Serpent!’ screamed#scream# the Pigeon.||

‘I|’m#be# <i>not</i> a serpent!’ said#say# Alice indignantly. ‘Let me alone!’||

‘Serpent, I say again!’ repeated#repeat# the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,
and added#add# with a kind of sob, ‘I|’ve#have# tried#try# every way, and nothing seems#seem#
to suit them!’||

‘I haven’t the least idea what you|’re#be# talking#talk# about,’ said#say# Alice.||

‘I|’ve#have# tried#try# the roots#root# of trees#tree#, and I|’ve#have# tried#try# banks#bank#, and I|’ve#have# tried#try#
hedges#hedge#,’ the Pigeon went#go# on, without attending#attend# to her;|| ‘but those
serpents#serpent#! There|’s#be# no pleasing#please# them!’||

Alice was#be# more and more puzzled#puzzle#, but she thought#think# there was#be# no use in
saying#say# anything more till the Pigeon had#have# finished#finish#.||

‘As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching#hatch# the eggs#egg#,’ said#say# the Pigeon;||
‘but I must be on the look-out for serpents#serpent# night and day!|| Why, I
haven’t had#have# a wink of sleep these three weeks#week#!’||

‘I|’m#be# very sorry you|’ve#have# been#be# annoyed#annoy#,’ said#say# Alice, who was#be# beginning#begin# to
see its meaning.||<page>

‘And just as I|’d#had# taken#take# the highest#high# tree in the wood,’ continued#continue# the
Pigeon, raising#raise# its voice to a shriek,|| ‘and just as I was#be# thinking#think# I
should be free of them at last, they must needs#need# come wriggling#wriggle# down from
the sky!|| Ugh, Serpent!’||

‘But I|’m#be# <i>not</i> a serpent, I tell you!’ said#say# Alice.|| ‘I|’m#be# a--I|’m#be# a--’

‘Well! <i>What</i> are#be# you?’ said#say# the Pigeon.|| ‘I can see you|’re#be# trying#try# to
invent something!’||

‘I--I|’m#be# a little girl,’ said#say# Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered#remember#
the number of changes#change# she had#have# gone#go# through that day.||

‘A likely story indeed!’ said#say# the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest#deep#
contempt.|| ‘I|’ve#have# seen#see# a good many little girls#girl# in my time, but never <i>one</i>
with such a neck as that!|| No, no! You’re#be# a serpent; and there|’s#be# no use
denying#deny# it.|| I suppose you|’ll#will# be telling#tell# me next that you never tasted#taste# an
egg!’||

‘I <i>have</i> tasted#taste# eggs#egg#, certainly,’ said#say# Alice, who was#be# a very truthful
child;|| ‘but little girls#girl# eat eggs#egg# quite as much as serpents#serpent# do, you
know.’||

‘I don’t believe it,’ said#say# the Pigeon; ‘but if they do, why then they’re#be#
a kind of serpent, that|’s#be# all I can say.’||<page>

This was#be# such a new idea to Alice, that she was#be# quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave#give# the Pigeon the opportunity of adding#add#, ‘You’re#be#
looking#look# for eggs#egg#, I know <i>that</i> well enough;|| and what does#do# it matter to me
whether you|’re#be# a little girl or a serpent?’||

‘It matters#matter# a good deal to <i>me</i>,’ said#say# Alice hastily;|| ‘but I|’m#be# not looking#look#
for eggs#egg#, as it happens#happen#;|| and if I was#be#, I shouldn’t want <i>yours</i>: I don’t
like them raw.’||

‘Well, be off, then!’ said#say# the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled#settle#
down again into its nest.|| Alice crouched#crouch# down among the trees#tree# as well as
she could, for her neck kept#keep# getting#get# entangled#entangle# among the branches#branch#, and
every now and then she had#have# to stop and untwist it.|| After a while she
remembered#remember# that she still held#hold# the pieces#piece# of mushroom in her hands#hand#,|| and
she set to work very carefully, nibbling#nibble# first at one and then at the
other, and growing#grow# sometimes taller and sometimes shorter#short#, until she had#have#
succeeded#succeed# in bringing#bring# herself down to her usual height.||<page>

It was#be# so long since she had#have# been#be# anything near the right size, that it
felt#feel# quite strange @at first@;|| but she @got used to@#get used to# it in a few minutes#minute#,
and began#begin# talking#talk# to herself, as usual.|| ‘Come, there|’s#be# half my plan done#do#
now!|| How puzzling#puzzle# all these changes#change# are#be#!|| I|’m#be# never sure what I|’m#be# going#go#
to be, from one minute to another!|| However, I|’ve#have# got#get# back to my right
size:|| the next thing is#be#, to get into that beautiful garden--how <i>is#be#</i> that
to be done#do#, I wonder?’|| As she said#say# this, she came#come# suddenly upon an open
place, with a little house in it about four feet#foot# high.|| ‘Whoever#whoever# lives#live#
there,’ thought#think# Alice,|| ‘it|’ll#will# never do to come upon them <i>this</i> size: why,
I should frighten them out of their wits#wit#!’|| So she began#begin# nibbling#nibble# at the
righthand bit again, and did#do# not venture to go near the house till she
had#have# brought#bring# herself down to nine inches#inch# high.||<page>

<h2>CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper||</h2>

For a minute or two she stood#stand# looking#look# at the house, and wondering#wonder# what
to do next,|| when suddenly a footman in livery came#come# running#run# out of the
wood--||(she considered#consider# him to be a footman because he was#be# in livery:
otherwise, judging#judge# by his face only, she would have called#call# him a
fish)||--and rapped#rap# loudly at the door with his knuckles#knuckle#.|| It was#be# opened#open#
by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes#eye# like a
frog; and both footmen#footman#, Alice noticed#notice#, had#have# powdered#powder# hair that curled#curl# all
over their heads#head#.|| She felt#feel# very curious to know what it was#be# all about,
and crept#creep# a little way out of the wood to listen.||

The Fish-|Footman began#begin# by producing#produce# from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed#hand# over to the other,
saying#say#, in a solemn tone, ‘For the Duchess.||<page> An invitation from the Queen
to play croquet.’|| The Frog-|Footman repeated#repeat#, in the same solemn tone,
only changing#change# the order of the words#word# a little, ‘From the Queen.|| An
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.’||
<img src="19TheFrogFootman.jpg" width="266" height="322" alt="The Frog Footman receives a letter"/>

Then they both bowed#bow# low, and their curls#curl# got#get# entangled#entangle# together.||

Alice laughed#laugh# so much at this, that she had#have# to run back into the
wood for fear of their hearing#hear# her;|| and when she next peeped#peep# out the
Fish-#fish#|Footman was#be# gone#go#, and the other was#be# sitting#sit# on the ground near the
door, staring#stare# stupidly up into the sky.||

Alice went#go# timidly up to the door, and knocked#knock#.||

‘There|’s#be# no sort of use in knocking,’ said#say# the Footman, ‘and that for
two reasons#reason#.|| First, because I|’m#be# on the same side of the door as you
are#be#; secondly, because they’re#be# making#make# such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you.’|| And certainly there was#be# a most extraordinary noise
going#go# on within--||a constant howling#howl# and sneezing#sneeze#, and every now and then
a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had#have# been#be# broken#break# to pieces#piece#.||<page>

‘Please, then,’ said#say# Alice, ‘how am#be# I to get in?’||

‘There might be some sense in your knocking,’ the Footman went#go# on
without attending#attend# to her, ‘if we had#have# the door between us.|| For instance,
if you were#be# <i>inside</i>, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.’||
He was#be# looking#look# up into the sky all the time he was#be# speaking#speak#, and this
Alice thought#think# decidedly uncivil.|| ‘But perhaps he can’t help it,’ she
said#say# to herself; ‘his eyes#eye# are#be# so <i>very</i> nearly at the top of his head.||
But at any rate he might answer questions#question#.--How am#be# I to get in?’ she
repeated#repeat#, aloud.||

‘I shall sit here,’ the Footman remarked#remark#, ‘till tomorrow--’||

At this moment the door of the house opened#open#, and a large plate came#come#
skimming#skim# out, straight at the Footman|’s head:|| it just grazed#graze# his nose,
and broke#break# to pieces#piece# against one of the trees#tree# behind him.||

‘--or next day, maybe,’ the Footman continued#continue# in the same tone, exactly
as if nothing had#have# happened#happen#.||

‘How am#be# I to get in?’ asked#ask# Alice again, in a louder tone.||<page>

‘<i>Are#be#</i> you to get in @at all@?’ said#say# the Footman. ‘That|’s#be# the first
question, you know.’||

It was#be#, no doubt: only Alice did#do# not like to be told#tell# so.|| ‘It|’s#be# really
dreadful,’ she muttered#mutter# to herself, ‘the way all the creatures#creature# argue.||
It|’s#be# enough to drive one crazy!’||<page>

The Footman seemed#seem# to think this a good opportunity for repeating#repeat# his
remark, with variations#variation#.|| ‘I shall sit here,’ he said#say#, ‘on and off, for
days#day# and days#day#.’||

‘But what am#be# I to do?’ said#say# Alice.||

‘Anything#anything# you like,’ said#say# the Footman, and began#begin# whistling#whistle#.||

‘Oh, there|’s#be# no use in talking#talk# to him,’ said#say# Alice desperately: ‘he|’s#be#
perfectly idiotic!’|| And she opened#open# the door and went#go# in.||

The door led#lead# right into a large kitchen, which was#be# full of smoke from
one end to the other:|| the Duchess was#be# sitting#sit# on a three-legged stool in
the middle, nursing#nurse# a baby;|| the cook was#be# leaning#lean# over the fire, stirring#stir#
a large cauldron which seemed#seem# to be full of soup.||
<img src="20TheDuchessAndTheCook.jpg" width="266" height="220" alt="Alice meets the Duchess, the Cook and the baby"/>

‘There|’s#be# certainly too much pepper in that soup!’ Alice said#say# to herself,
as well as she could for sneezing#sneeze#.||

There was#be# certainly too much of it in the air.|| Even the Duchess
sneezed#sneeze# occasionally; and as for the baby, it was#be# sneezing#sneeze# and howling#howl#
alternately without a moment|’s pause.||<page> The only things#thing# in the kitchen
that did#do# not sneeze, were#be# the cook, and a large cat which was#be# sitting#sit# on
the hearth and grinning#grin# from ear to ear.||

‘Please would you tell me,’ said#say# Alice, a little timidly, for she was#be#
not quite sure whether it was#be# good manners#manner# for her to speak first, ‘why
your cat grins#grin# like that?’||

‘It|’s#be# a Cheshire cat,’ said#say# the Duchess, ‘and that|’s#be# why.|| Pig!’

She said#say# the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped#jump#;|| but she saw#see# in another moment that it was#be# addressed#address# to the baby,
and not to her, so she took#take# courage, and went#go# on again:--||

‘I didn’t know that Cheshire cats#cat# always grinned#grin#; in fact, I didn’t know
that cats#cat# <i>could</i> grin.’||

‘They all can,’ said#say# the Duchess; ‘and most of ‘em do.’||

‘I don’t know of any that do,’ Alice said#say# very politely, feeling#feel# quite
pleased#please# to have got#get# into a conversation.||

‘You don’t know much,’ said#say# the Duchess; ‘and that|’s#be# a fact.’||

Alice did#do# not @at all@ like the tone of this remark, and thought#think# it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.||<page> While she
was#be# trying#try# to fix on one, the cook took#take# the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and @at once@ set to work throwing#throw# everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the baby--||the fire-irons came#come# first; then followed#follow# a
shower of saucepans#saucepan#, plates#plate#, and dishes#dish#.|| The Duchess took#take# no notice of
them even when they hit her;|| and the baby was#be# howling#howl# so much already,
that it was#be# quite impossible to say whether the blows#blow# hurt it or not.||

‘Oh, <i>please</i> mind what you|’re#be# doing#do#!’ cried#cry# Alice, jumping#jump# up and down in
an agony of terror.|| ‘Oh, there goes#go# his <i>precious</i> nose’; as an unusually
large saucepan flew#fly# close by it, and very nearly carried#carry# it off.||

‘If everybody minded#mind# their own business,’ the Duchess said#say# in a hoarse
growl, ‘the world would go round a deal faster#fast# than it does#do#.’||

‘Which would <i>not</i> be an advantage,’ said#say# Alice, who felt#feel# very glad to get
an opportunity of showing#show# off a little of her knowledge.|| ‘Just think of
what work it would make with the day and night!|| You see the earth takes#take#
twenty-four hours#hour# to turn round on its axis--’||<page>

‘Talking#talk# of axes#ax#,’ said#say# the Duchess, ‘chop off her head!’||

Alice glanced#glance# rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant#mean# to take
the hint;|| but the cook was#be# busily stirring#stir# the soup, and seemed#seem# not to
be listening#listen#, so she went#go# on again:|| ‘Twenty-four hours#hour#, I <i>think</i>; or is#be#
it twelve? I--’||

‘Oh, don’t bother <i>me</i>,’ said#say# the Duchess; ‘I never could abide figures#figure#!’||
And with that she began#begin# nursing#nurse# her child again, singing#sing# a sort of
lullaby to it as she did#do# so, and giving#give# it a violent shake at the end of
every line:||

   ‘Speak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes#sneeze#:||
   He only does#do# it to annoy,
    Because he knows#know# it teases.’||

         CHORUS.

 (In which the cook and the baby joined#join#):--

       ‘Wow! wow! wow!’||

While the Duchess sang#sing# the second verse of the song, she kept#keep# tossing#toss#
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled#howl# so,
that Alice could hardly hear the words#word#:--||<page>

   ‘I speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes#sneeze#;||
   For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases#please#!’||

         CHORUS.

       ‘Wow! wow! wow!’||

‘Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!’ the Duchess said#say# to Alice,
flinging#fling# the baby at her as she spoke#speak#.|| ‘I must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen,’ and she hurried#hurry# out of the room.|| The cook threw#throw#
a frying-pan after her as she went#go# out, but it just missed#miss# her.||

Alice caught#catch# the baby with some difficulty, as it was#be# a queer-#queer#|shaped#shape#
little creature, and held#hold# out its arms#arm# and legs#leg# in all directions#direction#,|| ‘just
like a star-fish,’ thought#think# Alice.|| The poor little thing was#be# snorting#snort#
like a steam-engine when she caught#catch# it, and kept#keep# doubling#double# itself up and
straightening#straighten# itself out again,|| so that altogether, for the first minute
or two, it was#be# as much as she could do to hold it.||<page>

As soon as she had#have# made#make# out the proper way of nursing#nurse# it, (which was#be# to
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing#undo# itself,) she carried#carry#
it out into the open air.|| ‘<i>If</i> I don’t take this child away with me,’
thought#think# Alice, ‘they’re#be# sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be
murder to leave it behind?’|| She said#say# the last words#word# out loud, and the
little thing grunted#grunt# in reply (it had#have# @left off@#leave off# sneezing#sneeze# by this time).||
‘Don’t grunt,’ said#say# Alice; ‘that|’s#be# not @at all@ a proper way of expressing#express#
yourself.’||

The baby grunted#grunt# again, and Alice looked#look# very anxiously into its face to
see what was#be# the matter with it.|| There could be no doubt that it had#have#
a <i>very</i> turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose;|| also its
eyes#eye# were#be# getting#get# extremely small for a baby:|| altogether Alice did#do# not
like the look of the thing @at all@.|| ‘But perhaps it was#be# only sobbing#sob#,’
she thought#think#, and looked#look# into its eyes#eye# again, to see if there were#be# any
tears#tear#.||

No, there were#be# no tears#tear#.|| ‘If you|’re#be# going#go# to @turn into@ a pig, my dear,’
said#say# Alice, seriously, ‘I|’ll#will# have nothing more to do with you. Mind
now!’||<page> The poor little thing sobbed#sob# again (or grunted#grunt#, it was#be# impossible
to say which), and they went#go# on for some while in silence.||

Alice was#be# just beginning#begin# to think to herself, ‘Now, what am#be# I to do with
this creature when I get it home?’ when it grunted#grunt# again, so violently,
that she looked#look# down into its face in some alarm.|| This time there could
be <i>no</i> mistake about it:|| it was#be# neither more nor less than a pig, and she
felt#feel# that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.||
<img src="21NeitherMoreNorLessThanAPig.jpg" width="194" height="288" alt="Alice is holding the baby, who has turned into a pig"/>

So she set the little creature down, and felt#feel# quite relieved#relieve# to see
it trot away quietly into the wood.|| ‘If it had#have# @grown up@#grow up#,’ she said#say#
to herself, ‘it would have made#make# a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes#make#
rather a handsome pig, I think.’|| And she began#begin# thinking#think# over other
children#child# she knew#know#, who might do very well as pigs#pig#,|| and was#be# just saying#say#
to herself, ‘if one only knew#know# the right way to change them--’ when she
was#be# a little startled#startle# by seeing#see# the Cheshire Cat sitting#sit# on a bough of a
tree a few yards#yard# off.||

The Cat only grinned#grin# when it saw#see# Alice.|| It looked#look# good-natured, she
thought#think#:|| still it had#have# <i>very</i> long claws#claw# and a great many teeth, so she
felt#feel# that it ought to be treated#treat# with respect.||<page>

‘Cheshire Puss,’ she began#begin#, rather timidly, as she did#do# not @at all@ know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned#grin# a little wider.||
‘Come, it|’s#be# pleased#please# so far,’ thought#think# Alice, and she went#go# on. ‘Would you
tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?’||
<img src="22ItOnlyGrinnedALittleWider.png" width="274" height="404" alt="Alice meets the Cheshire Cat"/>

‘That depends#depend# a good deal on where you want to get to,’ said#say# the Cat.||<page>

‘I don’t much care where--’ said#say# Alice.||

‘Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,’ said#say# the Cat.||

‘--so long as I get <i>somewhere</i>,’ Alice added#add# as an explanation.||

‘Oh, you|’re#be# sure to do that,’ said#say# the Cat, ‘if you only walk long
enough.’||

Alice felt#feel# that this could not be denied#deny#, so she tried#try# another question.
‘What sort of people live about here?’||

‘In <i>that</i> direction,’ the Cat said#say#, waving#wave# its right paw round, ‘lives#live#
a Hatter:|| and in <i>that</i> direction,’ waving#wave# the other paw, ‘lives#live# a March
Hare.|| Visit either you like: they’re#be# both mad.’||

‘But I don’t want to go among mad people,’ Alice remarked#remark#.||

‘Oh, you can’t help that,’ said#say# the Cat: ‘we’re#be# all mad here. I|’m#be# mad.
You’re#be# mad.’||

‘How do you know I|’m#be# mad?’ said#say# Alice.

‘You must be,’ said#say# the Cat, ‘or you wouldn’t have come here.’||

Alice didn’t think that proved#prove# it @at all@; however, she went#go# on ‘And how
do you know that you|’re#be# mad?’||<page>

‘To begin with,’ said#say# the Cat, ‘a dog|’s#be# not mad. You grant that?’

‘I suppose so,’ said#say# Alice.||

‘Well, then,’ the Cat went#go# on, ‘you see, a dog growls#growl# when it|’s#be# angry,
and wags#wag# its tail when it|’s#be# pleased#please#.|| Now I growl when I|’m#be# pleased#please#, and
wag my tail when I|’m#be# angry. Therefore#therefore# I|’m#be# mad.’||

‘I call it purring#purr#, not growling#growl#,’ said#say# Alice.||

‘Call it what you like,’ said#say# the Cat. ‘Do you play croquet with the
Queen to-day?’||

‘I should like it very much,’ said#say# Alice, ‘but I haven’t been#be# invited#invite#
yet.’||

‘You|’ll#will# see me there,’ said#say# the Cat, and vanished#vanish#.||

Alice was#be# not much surprised#surprise# at this, she was#be# @getting so used to@#get used to# queer
things#thing# happening#happen#.|| While she was#be# looking#look# at the place where it had#have# been#be#,
it suddenly appeared#appear# again.||

‘By-the-bye, what became#become# of the baby?’ said#say# the Cat. ‘I|’d#had# nearly
forgotten#forget# to ask.’||

‘It @turned into@#turn into# a pig,’ Alice quietly said#say#, just as if it had#have# come back
in a natural way.||<page>

‘I thought#think# it would,’ said#say# the Cat, and vanished#vanish# again.||

Alice waited#wait# a little, half expecting#expect# to see it again, but it did#do# not
appear,|| and after a minute or two she walked#walk# on in the direction in
which the March Hare was#be# said#say# to live.|| ‘I|’ve#have# seen#see# hatters#hatter# before,’ she
said#say# to herself;|| ‘the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is#be# May it won’t be raving#rave# mad--at least not so mad as
it was#be# in March.’|| As she said#say# this, she looked#look# up, and there was#be# the Cat
again, sitting#sit# on a branch of a tree.||

‘Did#do# you say pig, or fig?’ said#say# the Cat.||

‘I said#say# pig,’ replied#reply# Alice; ‘and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and
vanishing#vanish# so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.’||

‘@All right@,’ said#say# the Cat;|| and this time it vanished#vanish# quite slowly,
beginning#begin# with the end of the tail, and ending#end# with the grin, which
remained#remain# some time after the rest of it had#have# gone#go#.||
<img src="23EndingWithTheGrin.jpg" width="274" height="187" alt="Only the Cheshire Cat's grin is left"/>

‘Well!|| I|’ve#have# often seen#see# a cat without a grin,’ thought#think# Alice;|| ‘but a grin
without a cat!|| It|’s#be# the most curious thing I ever saw#see# in my life!’||<page>

She had#have# not gone#go# much farther before she came#come# in sight of the house
of the March Hare:|| she thought#think# it must be the right house, because the
chimneys#chimney# were#be# shaped#shape# like ears#ear# and the roof was#be# thatched#thatch# with fur.|| It
was#be# so large a house, that she did#do# not like to go nearer#near# till she had#have#
nibbled#nibble# some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised#raise# herself to
about two feet#foot# high:|| even then she walked#walk# up towards it rather timidly,
saying#say# to herself ‘Suppose it should be raving#rave# mad @after all@! I almost
wish I|’d#had# gone#go# to see the Hatter instead!’||<page>

<h2>CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-|Party||</h2>

There was#be# a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
March Hare and the Hatter were#be# having#have# tea at it:|| a Dormouse was#be# sitting#sit#
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were#be# using#use# it as a
cushion, resting#rest# their elbows#elbow# on it, and talking#talk# over its head.|| ‘Very
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,’ thought#think# Alice; ‘only, as it|’s#be# asleep, I
suppose it doesn’t mind.’||

The table was#be# a large one, but the three were#be# all crowded#crowd# together at
one corner of it:|| ‘No room!|| No room!’ they cried#cry# out when they saw#see# Alice
coming#come#.|| ‘There|’s#be# <i>plenty</i> of room!’ said#say# Alice indignantly, and she @sat
down@#sit down# in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.||

‘Have some wine,’ the March Hare said#say# in an encouraging tone.||<page>

Alice looked#look# all round the table, but there was#be# nothing on it but tea.||
‘I don’t see any wine,’ she remarked#remark#.||

‘There isn’t any,’ said#say# the March Hare.||

‘Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,’ said#say# Alice angrily.||

‘It wasn’t very civil of you to @sit down@ without being#be# invited#invite#,’ said#say#
the March Hare.||

‘I didn’t know it was#be# <i>your</i> table,’ said#say# Alice; ‘it|’s#be# laid#lay# for a great
many more than three.’||

‘Your hair wants#want# cutting#cut#,’ said#say# the Hatter.|| He had#have# been#be# looking#look# at Alice
for some time with great curiosity, and this was#be# his first speech.||

‘You should learn not to make personal remarks#remark#,’ Alice said#say# with some
severity; ‘it|’s#be# very rude.’||

The Hatter opened#open# his eyes#eye# very wide on hearing#hear# this; but all he SAID#say#
was#be#, ‘Why is#be# a raven like a writing-#write#|desk?’||
<img src="24RavensAndWritingDesks.jpg" width="283" height="221" alt="Alice sitting with the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the Dormouse"/>

‘Come, we shall have some fun now!’ thought#think# Alice.|| ‘I|’m#be# glad they|’ve#have#
begun#begin# asking#ask# riddles#riddle#.--I believe I can guess that,’ she added#add# aloud.||

‘Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?’ said#say# the
March Hare.||<page>

‘Exactly#exactly# so,’ said#say# Alice.||

‘Then you should say what you mean,’ the March Hare went#go# on.||

‘I do,’ Alice hastily replied#reply#; ‘at least--at least I mean what I
say--that|’s#be# the same thing, you know.’||

‘Not the same thing a bit!’ said#say# the Hatter.|| ‘You might just as well say
that “I see what I eat” is#be# the same thing as “I eat what I see”!’||

‘You might just as well say,’ added#add# the March Hare, ‘that “I like what I
get” is#be# the same thing as “I get what I like”!’||

‘You might just as well say,’ added#add# the Dormouse, who seemed#seem# to be
talking#talk# in his sleep, ‘that “I breathe when I sleep” is#be# the same thing
as “I sleep when I breathe”!’||

‘It <i>is#be#</i> the same thing with you,’ said#say# the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped#drop#,|| and the party sat#sit# silent for a minute, while Alice
thought#think# over all she could remember about ravens#raven# and writing-#write#|desks,
which wasn’t much.||<page>

The Hatter was#be# the first to break the silence. ‘What day of the month
is#be# it?’ he said#say#, turning#turn# to Alice:|| he had#have# taken#take# his watch out of his
pocket, and was#be# looking#look# at it uneasily, shaking#shake# it every now and then,
and holding#hold# it to his ear.||

Alice considered#consider# a little, and then said#say# ‘The fourth.’||

‘Two days#day# wrong!’ sighed#sigh# the Hatter. ‘I told#tell# you butter wouldn’t suit
the works#work#!’ he added#add# looking#look# angrily at the March Hare.||

‘It was#be# the <i>best</i> butter,’ the March Hare meekly replied#reply#.||

‘Yes, but some crumbs#crumb# must have got#get# in as well,’ the Hatter grumbled#grumble#:
‘you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-#bread#|knife.’||

The March Hare took#take# the watch and looked#look# at it gloomily: then he dipped#dip#
it into his cup of tea, and looked#look# at it again:|| but he could think of
nothing better#good# to say than his first remark, ‘It was#be# the <i>best</i> butter,
you know.’||

Alice had#have# been#be# looking#look# over his shoulder with some curiosity.|| ‘What a
funny watch!’ she remarked#remark#. ‘It tells#tell# the day of the month, and doesn’t
tell what o’clock it is#be#!’||

‘Why should it?’ muttered#mutter# the Hatter. ‘Does#do# <i>your</i> watch tell you what
year it is#be#?’||<page>

‘@Of course@ not,’ Alice replied#reply# very readily: ‘but that|’s#be# because it
stays#stay# the same year for such a long time together.’||

‘Which is#be# just the case with <i>mine</i>,’ said#say# the Hatter.||

Alice felt#feel# dreadfully puzzled#puzzle#.|| The Hatter|’s remark seemed#seem# to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was#be# certainly English.|| ‘I don’t quite
understand you,’ she said#say#, as politely as she could.||

‘The Dormouse is#be# asleep again,’ said#say# the Hatter, and he poured#pour# a little
hot tea upon its nose.||

The Dormouse shook#shake# its head impatiently, and said#say#, without opening#open# its
eyes#eye#, ‘@Of course@, @of course@; just what I was#be# going#go# to remark myself.’||

‘Have you guessed#guess# the riddle yet?’ the Hatter said#say#, turning#turn# to Alice
again.||

‘No, I give it up,’ Alice replied#reply#: ‘what|’s#be# the answer?’||

‘I haven’t the slightest#slight# idea,’ said#say# the Hatter.||

‘Nor I,’ said#say# the March Hare.||

Alice sighed#sigh# wearily.|| ‘I think you might do something better#good# with the
time,’ she said#say#, ‘than waste it in asking#ask# riddles#riddle# that have no answers.’||<page>

‘If you knew#know# Time as well as I do,’ said#say# the Hatter, ‘you wouldn’t talk
about wasting#waste# <i>it</i>. It|’s#be# <i>him</i>.’||

‘I don’t know what you mean,’ said#say# Alice.||

‘@Of course@ you don’t!’ the Hatter said#say#, tossing#toss# his head contemptuously.
‘I dare say you never even spoke#speak# to Time#time#!’||

‘Perhaps not,’ Alice cautiously replied#reply#: ‘but I know I have to beat time
when I learn music.’||

‘Ah! that accounts#account# for it,’ said#say# the Hatter.|| ‘He won’t stand beating#beat#.||
Now, if you only kept#keep# on good terms#term# with him, he|’d#would# do almost anything
you liked#like# with the clock.|| For instance, suppose it were#be# nine o’clock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons#lesson#:|| you|’d#would# only have to whisper a
hint to Time#time#, and round goes#go# the clock in a twinkling#twinkle#! Half-past#half-past# one,
time for dinner!’||

(‘I only wish it was#be#,’ the March Hare said#say# to itself in a whisper.)||

‘That would be grand, certainly,’ said#say# Alice thoughtfully: ‘but then--I
shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.’||<page>

‘Not @at first@, perhaps,’ said#say# the Hatter: ‘but you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked#like#.’||

‘Is#be# that the way <i>you</i> manage?’ Alice asked#ask#.||

The Hatter shook#shake# his head mournfully. ‘Not I!’ he replied#reply#.|| ‘We
quarrelled#quarrel# last March--just before <i>he</i> went#go# mad, you know--’ (pointing#point#
with his tea spoon at the March Hare,)|| ‘--it was#be# at the great concert
given#give# by the Queen of Hearts#heart#, and I had#have# to sing||

     “Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
     How I wonder what you|’re#be# at!”||

You know the song, perhaps?’

‘I|’ve#have# heard#hear# something like it,’ said#say# Alice.||

‘It goes#go# on, you know,’ the Hatter continued#continue#, ‘in this way:--||

     “Up above the world you fly,
     Like a tea-|tray in the sky.
         Twinkle, twinkle--“’||

Here the Dormouse shook#shake# itself, and began#begin# singing#sing# in its sleep ‘Twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--’ and went#go# on so long that they had#have# to pinch
it to make it stop.||<page>

‘Well, I|’d#had# hardly finished#finish# the first verse,’ said#say# the Hatter,|| ‘when the
Queen jumped#jump# up and bawled#bawl# out, “He|’s#be# murdering#murder# the time! Off with his
head!”’||

‘How dreadfully savage!’ exclaimed#exclaim# Alice.||

‘And ever since that,’ the Hatter went#go# on in a mournful tone, ‘he won’t
do a thing I ask! It|’s#be# always six o’clock now.’||
<img src="25AlwaysSixOClock.jpg" width="194" height="218" alt="The Mad Hatter explains to Alice"/>

A bright idea came#come# into Alice|’s head. ‘Is#be# that the reason so many
tea-|things#thing# are#be# put out here?’ she asked#ask#.||

‘Yes, that|’s#be# it,’ said#say# the Hatter with a sigh: ‘it|’s#be# always tea-|time,
and we|’ve#have# no time to wash the things#thing# between whiles.’||

‘Then you keep moving#move# round, I suppose?’ said#say# Alice.||

‘Exactly#exactly# so,’ said#say# the Hatter: ‘as the things#thing# get @used up@#use up#.’||

‘But what happens#happen# when you come to the beginning again?’ Alice ventured#venture#
to ask.||

‘Suppose we change the subject,’ the March Hare interrupted#interrupt#, yawning#yawn#.||
‘I|’m#be# getting#get# tired#tire# of this. I vote the young lady tells#tell# us a story.’||<page>

‘I|’m#be# afraid I don’t know one,’ said#say# Alice, rather alarmed#alarm# at the
proposal.||

‘Then the Dormouse shall!’ they both cried#cry#.|| ‘Wake up, Dormouse!’ And
they pinched#pinch# it on both sides#side# @at once@.||

The Dormouse slowly opened#open# his eyes#eye#.|| ‘I wasn’t asleep,’ he said#say# in a
hoarse, feeble voice: ‘I heard#hear# every word you fellows were#be# saying#say#.’||

‘Tell#tell# us a story!’ said#say# the March Hare.||

‘Yes, please do!’ pleaded#plead# Alice.||

‘And be quick about it,’ added#add# the Hatter, ‘or you|’ll#will# be asleep again
before it|’s#be# done#do#.’||

‘Once upon a time there were#be# three little sisters#sister#,’ the Dormouse began#begin#
in a great hurry;|| ‘and their names#name# were#be# Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
they lived#live# at the bottom of a well--’||

‘What did#do# they live on?’ said#say# Alice, who always took#take# a great interest in
questions#question# of eating and drinking.||

‘They lived#live# on treacle,’ said#say# the Dormouse, after thinking#think# a minute or
two.||

‘They couldn’t have done#do# that, you know,’ Alice gently remarked#remark#; ‘they|’d#would#
have been#be# ill.’||<page>

‘So they were#be#,’ said#say# the Dormouse; ‘<i>very</i> ill.’||

Alice tried#try# to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way#way# of
living would be like, but it puzzled#puzzle# her too much, so she went#go# on:|| ‘But
why did#do# they live at the bottom of a well?’||

‘Take some more tea,’ the March Hare said#say# to Alice, very earnestly.||

‘I|’ve#have# had#have# nothing yet,’ Alice replied#reply# in an offended#offend# tone, ‘so I can’t
take more.’||

‘You mean you can’t take <i>less</i>,’ said#say# the Hatter: ‘it|’s#be# very easy to take
<i>more</i> than nothing.’||

‘Nobody asked#ask# <i>your</i> opinion,’ said#say# Alice.||

‘Who|’s#be# making#make# personal remarks#remark# now?’ the Hatter asked#ask# triumphantly.||

Alice did#do# not quite know what to say to this: so she helped#help# herself
to some tea and bread-|and-|butter, and then turned#turn# to the Dormouse, and
repeated#repeat# her question.|| ‘Why did#do# they live at the bottom of a well?’||

The Dormouse again took#take# a minute or two to think about it, and then
said#say#, ‘It was#be# a treacle-#treacle#|well.’||

‘There|’s#be# no such thing!’ Alice was#be# beginning#begin# very angrily, but the
Hatter and the March Hare went#go# ‘Sh! sh!’|| and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked#remark#, ‘If you can’t be civil, you|’d#had# better#good# finish the story for
yourself.’||<page>

‘No, please go on!’ Alice said#say# very humbly; ‘I won’t interrupt again. I
dare say there may be <i>one</i>.’||

‘One, indeed!’ said#say# the Dormouse indignantly.|| However, he consented#consent# to
go on. ‘And so these three little sisters#sister#--they were#be# learning#learn# to draw,
you know--’||

‘What did#do# they draw?’ said#say# Alice, quite forgetting#forget# her promise.||

‘Treacle,’ said#say# the Dormouse, without considering#consider# @at all@ this time.||

‘I want a clean cup,’ interrupted#interrupt# the Hatter: ‘let|’s#us# all move one place
on.’||

He moved#move# on as he spoke#speak#, and the Dormouse followed#follow# him:|| the March Hare
moved#move# into the Dormouse|’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took#take#
the place of the March Hare.|| The Hatter was#be# the only one who got#get# any
advantage from the change:|| and Alice was#be# a good deal worse#bad# off than
before, as the March Hare had#have# just upset the milk-#milk#|jug into his plate.||<page>

Alice did#do# not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began#begin# very
cautiously: ‘But I don’t understand. Where did#do# they draw the treacle
from?’||

‘You can draw water out of a water-|well,’ said#say# the Hatter; ‘so I should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-#treacle#|well--eh, stupid?’||

‘But they were#be# <i>in</i> the well,’ Alice said#say# to the Dormouse, not choosing#choose# to
notice this last remark.||

‘@Of course@ they were#be#’, said#say# the Dormouse; ‘--well in.’||

This answer so confused#confuse# poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting#interrupt# it.||

‘They were#be# learning#learn# to draw,’ the Dormouse went#go# on, yawning#yawn# and rubbing#rub#
its eyes#eye#, for it was#be# getting#get# very sleepy;|| ‘and they drew#draw# all manner of
things#thing#--everything that begins#begin# with an M--’||

‘Why with an M?’ said#say# Alice.

‘Why not?’ said#say# the March Hare.||

Alice was#be# silent.||<page>

The Dormouse had#have# closed#close# its eyes#eye# by this time, and was#be# going#go# off into
a doze;|| but, on being#be# pinched#pinch# by the Hatter, it woke#wake# up again with
a little shriek, and went#go# on:|| ‘--that begins#begin# with an M, such as
mouse-|traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say
things#thing# are#be# “much of a muchness”--did#do# you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness?’||

‘Really, now you ask me,’ said#say# Alice, very much confused#confuse#, ‘I don’t
think--’||

‘Then you shouldn’t talk,’ said#say# the Hatter.||

This piece of rudeness was#be# more than Alice could bear: she @got up@#get up# in
great disgust, and walked#walk# off;|| the Dormouse @fell asleep@#fall asleep# instantly, and
neither of the others took#take# the least notice of her going#go#, though she
looked#look# back once or twice, half hoping#hope# that they would call after her:||
the last time she saw#see# them, they were#be# trying#try# to put the Dormouse into
the teapot.||
<img src="26PuttingTheDormouseIntoTheTeapot.jpg" width="268" height="238" alt="The Mad Hatter and the March Hare try to put the Dormouse into the teapot"/>

‘At any rate I|’ll#will# never go <i>there</i> again!’ said#say# Alice as she picked#pick# her
way through the wood. ‘It|’s#be# the stupidest#stupid# tea-|party I ever was#be# at in all
my life!’||<page>

Just as she said#say# this, she noticed#notice# that one of the trees#tree# had#have# a door
leading#lead# right into it.|| ‘That|’s#be# very curious!’ she thought#think#. ‘But
everything|’s#be# curious today.|| I think I may as well go in @at once@.’ And in
she went#go#.||

Once more she found#find# herself in the long hall, and close to the little
glass table.|| ‘Now, I|’ll#will# manage better#good# this time,’ she said#say# to herself,
and began#begin# by taking#take# the little golden key, and unlocking#unlock# the door that
led#lead# into the garden.|| Then she went#go# to work nibbling#nibble# at the mushroom (she
had#have# kept#keep# a piece of it in her pocket) till she was#be# about a foot high:||
then she walked#walk# down the little passage: and <i>then</i>--she found#find# herself at
last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-|beds#bed# and the cool
fountains#fountain#.||<page>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII. The Queen|’s Croquet-|Ground||</h2>

A large rose-|tree stood#stand# near the entrance of the garden:|| the roses#rose#
growing#grow# on it were#be# white, but there were#be# three gardeners#gardener# at it, busily
painting#paint# them red.|| Alice thought#think# this a very curious thing, and she went#go#
nearer#near# to watch them,|| and just as she came#come# up to them she heard#hear# one of
them say, ‘Look#look# out now, Five!|| Don’t go splashing#splash# paint over me like
that!’||

‘I couldn’t help it,’ said#say# Five, in a sulky tone; ‘Seven jogged#jog# my
elbow.’||

On which Seven looked#look# up and said#say#, ‘That|’s#be# right, Five! Always#always# lay the
blame on others!’||

‘<i>You|’d#had#</i> better#good# not talk!’ said#say# Five. ‘I heard#hear# the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved#deserve# to be beheaded#behead#!’||

‘What for?’ said#say# the one who had#have# spoken#speak# first.||<page>

‘That|’s#be# none of <i>your</i> business, Two!’ said#say# Seven.||

‘Yes, it <i>is#be#</i> his business!’ said#say# Five, ‘and I|’ll#will# tell him--it was#be# for
bringing#bring# the cook tulip-#tulip#|roots#root# instead of onions.’||

Seven flung#fling# down his brush, and had#have# just begun#begin# ‘Well, of all the unjust
things#thing#--’ when his eye chanced#chance# to fall upon Alice, as she stood#stand# watching#watch#
them,|| and he checked#check# himself suddenly: the others looked#look# round also, and
all of them bowed#bow# low.||

‘Would you tell me,’ said#say# Alice, a little timidly, ‘why you are#be# painting#paint#
those roses#rose#?’||
<img src="27WhyAreYouPaintingThoseRoses.jpg" width="214" height="303" alt="The three soldiers are painting the rose-bush"/>

Five and Seven said#say# nothing, but looked#look# at Two.|| Two began#begin# in a low
voice, ‘Why the fact is#be#, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been#be# a
<i>red</i> rose-|tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen
was#be# to find it out, we should all have our heads#head# cut off, you know.||
So you see, Miss, we’re#be# doing#do# our best, afore she comes#come#, to--’ At this
moment Five, who had#have# been#be# anxiously looking#look# across the garden, called#call#
out ‘The Queen! The Queen!’|| and the three gardeners#gardener# instantly threw#throw#
themselves flat upon their faces#face#.|| There was#be# a sound of many footsteps#footstep#,
and Alice looked#look# round, eager to see the Queen.||<page>

First came#come# ten soldiers#soldier# carrying#carry# clubs#club#; these were#be# all shaped#shape# like
the three gardeners#gardener#, oblong and flat, with their hands#hand# and feet#foot# at the
corners#corner#:|| next the ten courtiers#courtier#; these were#be# ornamented#ornament# all over with
diamonds#diamond#, and walked#walk# two and two, as the soldiers#soldier# did#do#.|| After these came#come#
the royal children#child#; there were#be# ten of them, and the little dears#dear# came#come#
jumping#jump# merrily along hand in hand, in couples#couple#: they were#be# all ornamented#ornament#
with hearts#heart#.|| Next came#come# the guests#guest#, mostly Kings#king# and Queens#queen#, and among
them Alice recognised#recognise# the White Rabbit:|| it was#be# talking#talk# in a hurried#hurry#
nervous manner, smiling#smile# at everything that was#be# said#say#, and went#go# by without
noticing#notice# her.|| Then followed#follow# the Knave of Hearts#heart#, carrying#carry# the King|’s
crown on a crimson velvet cushion;|| and, last of all this grand
procession, came#come# THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS#heart#.||

Alice was#be# rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three gardeners#gardener#, but she could not remember ever having#have# heard#hear#
of such a rule at processions#procession#;||<page> ‘and besides, what would be the use of
a procession,’ thought#think# she, ‘if people had#have# all to lie down upon their
faces#face#, so that they couldn’t see it?’|| So she stood#stand# still where she was#be#,
and waited#wait#.||

When the procession came#come# opposite to Alice, they all stopped#stop# and looked#look#
at her, and the Queen said#say# severely ‘Who is#be# this?’|| She said#say# it to the
Knave of Hearts#heart#, who only bowed#bow# and smiled#smile# in reply.||

‘Idiot!’ said#say# the Queen, tossing#toss# her head impatiently; and, turning#turn# to
Alice, she went#go# on, ‘What|’s#be# your name, child?’||

‘My name is#be# Alice, so please your Majesty,’ said#say# Alice very politely;||
but she added#add#, to herself, ‘Why, they’re#be# only a pack of cards#card#, after
all. I needn’t be afraid of them!’||

‘And who are#be# <i>these</i>?’ said#say# the Queen, pointing#point# to the three gardeners#gardener# who
were#be# lying#lie# round the rose-|tree;|| for, you see, as they were#be# lying#lie# on their
faces#face#, and the pattern on their backs#back# was#be# the same as the rest of the
pack, she could not tell whether they were#be# gardeners#gardener#, or soldiers#soldier#, or
courtiers#courtier#, or three of her own children#child#.||

‘How should I know?’ said#say# Alice, surprised#surprise# at her own courage. ‘It|’s#be# no
business of <i>mine</i>.’||<page>

The Queen turned#turn# crimson with fury, and, after glaring#glare# at her for a
moment like a wild beast, screamed#scream# ‘Off with her head! Off--’||
<img src="28CrimsonWithFury.jpg" width="266" height="316" alt="The Queen screams at Alice"/>

‘Nonsense!’ said#say# Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was#be#
silent.||

The King laid#lay# his hand upon her arm, and timidly said#say# ‘Consider, my
dear: she is#be# only a child!’||

The Queen turned#turn# angrily away from him, and said#say# to the Knave ‘Turn them
over!’||

The Knave did#do# so, very carefully, with one foot.||

‘@Get up@!’ said#say# the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
gardeners#gardener# instantly jumped#jump# up, and began#begin# bowing#bow# to the King, the Queen,
the royal children#child#, and everybody else.||

‘@Leave off@ that!’ screamed#scream# the Queen. ‘You make me giddy.’|| And then,
turning#turn# to the rose-|tree, she went#go# on, ‘What <i>have</i> you been#be# doing#do# here?’||

‘May it please your Majesty,’ said#say# Two, in a very humble tone, going#go#
down on one knee as he spoke#speak#, ‘we were#be# trying#try#--’||<page>

‘I see!’ said#say# the Queen, who had#have# meanwhile been#be# examining#examine# the roses#rose#.
‘Off with their heads#head#!’|| and the procession moved#move# on, three of the
soldiers#soldier# remaining#remain# behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners#gardener#, who ran#run#
to Alice for protection.||

‘You shan’t be beheaded#behead#!’ said#say# Alice, and she put them into a large
flower-#flower#|pot that stood#stand# near.|| The three soldiers#soldier# wandered#wander# about for a
minute or two, looking#look# for them, and then quietly marched#march# off after the
others.||

‘Are#be# their heads#head# off?’ shouted#shout# the Queen.||

‘Their heads#head# are#be# gone#go#, if it please your Majesty!’ the soldiers#soldier# shouted#shout#
in reply.||

‘That|’s#be# right!’ shouted#shout# the Queen. ‘Can#can# you play croquet?’||

The soldiers#soldier# were#be# silent, and looked#look# at Alice, as the question was#be#
evidently meant#mean# for her.||

‘Yes!’ shouted#shout# Alice.||

‘@Come on@, then!’ roared#roar# the Queen, and Alice joined#join# the procession,
wondering#wonder# very much what would happen next.||

‘It|’s#be#--it|’s#be# a very fine day!’ said#say# a timid voice at her side.|| She was#be#
walking#walk# by the White Rabbit, who was#be# peeping#peep# anxiously into her face.||<page>

‘Very,’ said#say# Alice: ‘--where|’s#be# the Duchess?’||

‘Hush! Hush!’ said#say# the Rabbit in a low, hurried#hurry# tone.|| He looked#look#
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke#speak#, and then raised#raise# himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered#whisper# ‘She|’s#be# under
sentence of execution.’||

‘What for?’ said#say# Alice.||

‘Did#do# you say “What a pity!”?’ the Rabbit asked#ask#.||

‘No, I didn’t,’ said#say# Alice: ‘I don’t think it|’s#be# @at all@ a pity. I said#say#
“What for?”’||

‘She boxed#box# the Queen|’s ears#ear#--’ the Rabbit began#begin#.|| Alice gave#give# a little
scream of laughter.|| ‘Oh, hush!’ the Rabbit whispered#whisper# in a frightened#frighten#
tone.|| ‘The Queen will hear you! You see, she came#come# rather late, and the
Queen said#say#--’||

‘Get to your places#place#!’ shouted#shout# the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began#begin# running#run# about in all directions#direction#, tumbling#tumble# up against each
other;|| however, they got#get# settled#settle# down in a minute or two, and the game
began#begin#.||<page> Alice thought#think# she had#have# never seen#see# such a curious croquet-#croquet#|ground in
her life; it was#be# all ridges#ridge# and furrows#furrow#;|| the balls#ball# were#be# live hedgehogs#hedgehog#,
the mallets#mallet# live flamingoes#flamingo#, and the soldiers#soldier# had#have# to double themselves
up and to stand on their hands#hand# and feet#foot#, to make the arches#arch#.||
<img src="29DifficultyManagingHerFlamingo.jpg" width="194" height="278" alt="Alice holding her flamingo"/>

The chief difficulty Alice found#find# @at first@ was#be# in managing#manage# her flamingo:||
she succeeded#succeed# in getting#get# its body tucked#tuck# away, comfortably enough, under
her arm, with its legs#leg# hanging#hang# down,|| but generally, just as she had#have# got#get#
its neck nicely straightened#straighten# out, and was#be# going#go# to give the hedgehog a
blow with its head, it <i>would</i> twist itself round and look up in her face,
with such a puzzled#puzzle# expression that she could not help bursting#burst# out
laughing#laugh#:||<page> and when she had#have# got#get# its head down, and was#be# going#go# to begin
again, it was#be# very provoking#provoke# to find that the hedgehog had#have# unrolled#unroll#
itself, and was#be# in the act of crawling#crawl# away:|| besides all this, there was#be#
generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted#want# to send the
hedgehog to,|| and, as the doubled-up soldiers#soldier# were#be# always @getting up@#get up#
and walking#walk# off to other parts#part# of the ground, Alice soon came#come# to the
conclusion that it was#be# a very difficult game indeed.||

The players#player# all played#play# @at once@ without waiting#wait# for turns#turn#, quarrelling#quarrel#
all the while, and fighting#fight# for the hedgehogs#hedgehog#;|| and in a very short
time the Queen was#be# in a furious passion, and went#go# stamping#stamp# about, and
shouting#shout# ‘Off with his head!’ or ‘Off with her head!’ about once in a
minute.||

Alice began#begin# to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had#have# not as yet had#have# any
dispute with the Queen, but she knew#know# that it might happen any minute,
‘and then,’ thought#think# she, ‘what would become of me?|| They’re#be# dreadfully
fond of beheading#behead# people here; the great wonder is#be#, that there|’s#be# any one
left#leave# alive!’||

She was#be# looking#look# about for some way of escape, and wondering#wonder# whether she
could get away without being#be# seen#see#, when she noticed#notice# a curious appearance
in the air:||<page> it puzzled#puzzle# her very much @at first@, but, after watching#watch# it
a minute or two, she made#make# it out to be a grin, and she said#say# to herself
‘It|’s#be# the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.’||

‘How are#be# you @getting on@#get on#?’ said#say# the Cat, as soon as there was#be# mouth
enough for it to speak with.||

Alice waited#wait# till the eyes#eye# appeared#appear#, and then nodded#nod#.|| ‘It|’s#be# no use
speaking#speak# to it,’ she thought#think#, ‘till its ears#ear# have come, or at least one
of them.’|| In another minute the whole head appeared#appear#, and then Alice put
down her flamingo, and began#begin# an account of the game, feeling#feel# very glad
she had#have# someone to listen to her.|| The Cat seemed#seem# to think that there was#be#
enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared#appear#.||

‘I don’t think they play @at all@ fairly,’ Alice began#begin#, in rather a
complaining#complain# tone, ‘and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear
oneself speak--||and they don’t seem to have any rules#rule# in particular;
at least, if there are#be#, nobody attends to them--||and you|’ve#have# no idea how
confusing it is#be# all the things#thing# being#be# alive; for instance, there|’s#be# the
arch I|’ve#have# got#get# to go through next walking#walk# about at the other end of the
ground--||and I should have croqueted#croquet# the Queen|’s hedgehog just now, only
it ran#run# away when it saw#see# mine coming#come#!’||<page>

‘How do you like the Queen?’ said#say# the Cat in a low voice.||

‘Not @at all@,’ said#say# Alice: ‘she|’s#be# so extremely--’|| Just then she noticed#notice#
that the Queen was#be# close behind her, listening#listen#: so she went#go# on,
‘--likely to win, that it|’s#be# hardly worth while finishing#finish# the game.’||

The Queen smiled#smile# and passed#pass# on.||

‘Who <i>are#be#</i> you talking#talk# to?’ said#say# the King, going#go# up to Alice, and looking#look#
at the Cat|’s head with great curiosity.||

‘It|’s#be# a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,’ said#say# Alice: ‘allow me to
introduce it.’||<page>

‘I don’t like the look of it @at all@,’ said#say# the King: ‘however, it may
kiss my hand if it likes.’||

‘I|’d#would# rather not,’ the Cat remarked#remark#.||

‘Don’t be impertinent,’ said#say# the King, ‘and don’t look at me like that!’
He got#get# behind Alice as he spoke#speak#.||

‘A cat may look at a king,’ said#say# Alice. ‘I|’ve#have# read that in some book,
but I don’t remember where.’||

‘Well, it must be removed#remove#,’ said#say# the King very decidedly,|| and he called#call#
the Queen, who was#be# passing#pass# at the moment, ‘My dear! I wish you would
have this cat removed#remove#!’||

The Queen had#have# only one way of settling#settle# all difficulties#difficulty#, great or small.||
‘Off with his head!’ she said#say#, without even looking#look# round.||

‘I|’ll#will# fetch the executioner myself,’ said#say# the King eagerly, and he
hurried#hurry# off.||

Alice thought#think# she might as well go back, and see how the game was#be# going#go#
on, as she heard#hear# the Queen|’s voice in the distance, screaming#scream# with
passion.|| She had#have# already heard#hear# her sentence three of the players#player# to be
executed#execute# for having#have# missed#miss# their turns#turn#, and she did#do# not like the look
of things#thing# @at all@,|| as the game was#be# in such confusion that she never knew#know#
whether it was#be# her turn or not.|| So she went#go# in search of her hedgehog.||<page>

The hedgehog was#be# engaged#engage# in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed#seem#
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting#croquet# one of them with the
other:|| the only difficulty was#be#, that her flamingo was#be# gone#go# across to the
other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying#try# in a helpless
sort of way to fly up into a tree.||

By the time she had#have# caught#catch# the flamingo and brought#bring# it back, the fight
was#be# over, and both the hedgehogs#hedgehog# were#be# out of sight:|| ‘but it doesn’t
matter much,’ thought#think# Alice, ‘as all the arches#arch# are#be# gone#go# from this side
of the ground.’|| So she tucked#tuck# it away under her arm, that it might not
escape again, and went#go# back for a little more conversation with her
friend.||

When she got#get# back to the Cheshire Cat, she was#be# surprised#surprise# to find quite a
large crowd collected#collect# round it:|| there was#be# a dispute going#go# on between
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were#be# all talking#talk# @at once@,
while all the rest were#be# quite silent, and looked#look# very uncomfortable.||<page>

The moment Alice appeared#appear#, she was#be# appealed#appeal# to by all three to settle
the question,|| and they repeated#repeat# their arguments#argument# to her, though, as they
all spoke#speak# @at once@, she found#find# it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said#say#.||
<img src="30TheExecutionersArgument.jpg" width="278" height="355" alt="The King, the Queen and the executioner arguing"/>

The executioner|’s argument was#be#, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless
there was#be# a body to cut it off from:|| that he had#have# never had#have# to do such a
thing before, and he wasn’t going#go# to begin at <i>his</i> time of life.||

The King|’s argument was#be#, that anything that had#have# a head could be
beheaded#behead#, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.||

The Queen|’s argument was#be#, that if something wasn’t done#do# about it in less
than no time she|’d#would# have everybody executed#execute#, @all round@.|| (It was#be# this last
remark that had#have# made#make# the whole party look so grave and anxious.)||<page>

Alice could think of nothing else to say but ‘It belongs#belong# to the Duchess:
you|’d#had# better#good# ask <i>her</i> about it.’||

‘She|’s#be# in prison,’ the Queen said#say# to the executioner: ‘fetch her here.’
And the executioner went#go# off like an arrow.||

 The Cat|’s head began#begin# fading#fade# away the moment he was#be# gone#go#, and,
by the time he had#have# come back with the Duchess, it had#have# entirely
disappeared#disappear#;|| so the King and the executioner ran#run# wildly up and down
looking#look# for it, while the rest of the party went#go# back to the game.||<page>

<h2>CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle|’s Story||</h2>

‘You can’t think how glad I am#be# to see you again, you dear old thing!’
said#say# the Duchess, as she tucked#tuck# her arm affectionately into Alice|’s, and
they walked#walk# off together.||

Alice was#be# very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought#think#
to herself that perhaps it was#be# only the pepper that had#have# made#make# her so
savage when they met#meet# in the kitchen.||

‘When <i>I’m#be#</i> a Duchess,’ she said#say# to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone
though), ‘I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen <i>@at all@</i>.|| Soup does#do# very
well without--Maybe it|’s#be# always pepper that makes#make# people hot-tempered,’
she went#go# on, very much pleased#please# at having#have# found#find# out a new kind of
rule,|| ‘and vinegar that makes#make# them sour--and camomile that makes#make#
them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things#thing# that make children#child#
sweet-tempered.|| I only wish people knew#know# that: then they wouldn’t be so
stingy about it, you know--’||<page>

She had#have# quite forgotten#forget# the Duchess by this time, and was#be# a little
startled#startle# when she heard#hear# her voice close to her ear.|| ‘You’re#be# thinking#think#
about something, my dear, and that makes#make# you forget to talk.|| I can’t
tell you just now what the moral of that is#be#, but I shall remember it in
a bit.’||

‘Perhaps it hasn’t one,’ Alice ventured#venture# to remark.||

‘Tut, tut, child!’ said#say# the Duchess.|| ‘Everything|’s#have# got#get# a moral, if only
you can find it.’ And she squeezed#squeeze# herself up closer#close# to Alice|’s side as
she spoke#speak#.||

Alice did#do# not much like keeping#keep# so close to her:|| first, because the
Duchess was#be# <i>very</i> ugly; and secondly, because she was#be# exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon Alice|’s shoulder, and it was#be# an
uncomfortably sharp chin.|| However, she did#do# not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.||

‘The game|’s#be# going#go# on rather better#good# now,’ she said#say#, by way of keeping#keep# up
the conversation a little.||

‘’Tis#’tis# so,’ said#say# the Duchess: ‘and the moral of that is#be#--“Oh, ’tis#’tis# love,
’tis#’tis# love, that makes#make# the world go round!”’||<page>

‘Somebody#somebody# said#say#,’ Alice whispered#whisper#, ‘that it|’s#be# done#do# by everybody minding#mind#
their own business!’||

‘Ah, well! It means#mean# much the same thing,’ said#say# the Duchess, digging#dig# her
sharp little chin into Alice|’s shoulder as she added#add#, ‘and the moral
of <i>that</i> is#be#--“Take care of the sense, and the sounds#sound# will take care of
themselves.”’||

‘How fond she is#be# of finding#find# morals#moral# in things#thing#!’ Alice thought#think# to herself.||

‘I dare say you|’re#be# wondering#wonder# why I don’t put my arm round your waist,’
the Duchess said#say# after a pause: ‘the reason is#be#, that I|’m#be# doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo.|| Shall#shall# I try the experiment?’||

‘He might bite,’ Alice cautiously replied#reply#, not feeling#feel# @at all@ anxious to
have the experiment tried#try#.||

‘Very true,’ said#say# the Duchess:|| ‘flamingoes#flamingo# and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that is#be#--“Birds#bird# of a feather flock together.”’||

‘Only mustard isn’t a bird,’ Alice remarked#remark#.||
<img src="31MustardIsntABird.jpg" width="219" height="318" alt="Alice talking with the Duchess"/><page>

‘Right, as usual,’ said#say# the Duchess: ‘what a clear way you have of
putting#put# things#thing#!’||

‘It|’s#be# a mineral, I <i>think</i>,’ said#say# Alice.||

‘@Of course@ it is#be#,’ said#say# the Duchess, who seemed#seem# ready to agree to
everything that Alice said#say#; ‘there|’s#be# a large mustard-#mustard#|mine near here.|| And
the moral of that is#be#--“The more there is#be# of mine, the less there is#be# of
yours.”’||

‘Oh, I know!’ exclaimed#exclaim# Alice, who had#have# not attended#attend# to this last remark,
‘it|’s#be# a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is#be#.’||

‘I quite agree with you,’ said#say# the Duchess; ‘and the moral of that
is#be#--“Be what you would seem to be”--||or if you|’d#would# like it put more
simply--“Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were#be# or might have been#be# was#be# not otherwise
than what you had#have# been#be# would have appeared#appear# to them to be otherwise.”’||

‘I think I should understand that better#good#,’ Alice said#say# very politely, ‘if
I had#have# it written#write# down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.’||<page>

‘That|’s#be# nothing to what I could say if I chose#choose#,’ the Duchess replied#reply#, in
a pleased#please# tone.||

‘Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer#long# than that,’ said#say#
Alice.||

‘Oh, don’t talk about trouble!’ said#say# the Duchess. ‘I make you a present
of everything I|’ve#have# said#say# as yet.’||

‘A cheap sort of present!’ thought#think# Alice.|| ‘I|’m#be# glad they don’t give
birthday presents#present# like that!’ But she did#do# not venture to say it out
loud.||

‘Thinking#think# again?’ the Duchess asked#ask#, with another dig of her sharp
little chin.||

‘I|’ve#have# a right to think,’ said#say# Alice sharply, for she was#be# beginning#begin# to
feel a little worried.||

‘Just about as much right,’ said#say# the Duchess, ‘as pigs#pig# have to fly; and
the m--’||

But here, to Alice|’s great surprise, the Duchess|’s voice died#die# away, even
in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was#be# linked#link#
into hers began#begin# to tremble.|| Alice looked#look# up, and there stood#stand# the Queen
in front of them, with her arms#arm# folded#fold#, frowning#frown# like a thunderstorm.||<page>

‘A fine day, your Majesty!’ the Duchess began#begin# in a low, weak voice.||

‘Now, I give you fair warning#warn#,’ shouted#shout# the Queen, stamping#stamp# on the
ground as she spoke#speak#; ‘either you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time! Take your choice!’||

The Duchess took#take# her choice, and was#be# gone#go# in a moment.||

‘Let|’s#us# go on with the game,’ the Queen said#say# to Alice; and Alice was#be#
too much frightened#frighten# to say a word, but slowly followed#follow# her back to the
croquet-#croquet#|ground.||

The other guests#guest# had#have# taken#take# advantage of the Queen|’s absence, and were#be#
resting#rest# in the shade:|| however, the moment they saw#see# her, they hurried#hurry#
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking#remark# that a moment|’s delay would
cost them their lives#life#.||

All the time they were#be# playing#play# the Queen never @left off@#leave off# quarrelling#quarrel# with
the other players#player#, and shouting#shout# ‘Off with his head!’ or ‘Off with her
head!’|| Those#those# whom she sentenced#sentence# were#be# taken#take# into custody by the soldiers#soldier#,
who @of course@ had#have# to @leave off@ being#be# arches#arch# to do this, so that by
the end of half an hour or so there were#be# no arches#arch# left#leave#,|| and all the
players#player#, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were#be# in custody and
under sentence of execution.||<page>

Then the Queen @left off@#leave off#, quite out of breath, and said#say# to Alice, ‘Have
you seen#see# the Mock Turtle yet?’||

‘No,’ said#say# Alice. ‘I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is#be#.’||

‘It|’s#be# the thing Mock Turtle Soup#soup# is#be# made#make# from,’ said#say# the Queen.||

‘I never saw#see# one, or heard#hear# of one,’ said#say# Alice.||

‘@Come on@, then,’ said#say# the Queen, ‘and he shall tell you his history,’||

As they walked#walk# off together, Alice heard#hear# the King say in a low voice,
to the company generally, ‘You are#be# all pardoned.’|| ‘Come, <i>that|’s#be#</i> a good
thing!’ she said#say# to herself, for she had#have# felt#feel# quite unhappy at the
number of executions#execution# the Queen had#have# ordered#order#.||
<img src="32TheGryphon.jpg" width="279" height="195" alt="The Gryphon"/>

They very soon came#come# upon a Gryphon, lying#lie# fast asleep in the sun.||
(If you don’t know what a Gryphon is#be#, look at the picture.)|| ‘Up, lazy
thing!’ said#say# the Queen, ‘and take this young lady to see the Mock
Turtle, and to hear his history.|| I must go back and see after some
executions#execution# I have ordered#order#’;||<page> and she walked#walk# off, leaving#leave# Alice alone with
the Gryphon.|| Alice did#do# not quite like the look of the creature, but on
the whole she thought#think# it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go
after that savage Queen: so she waited#wait#.||

The Gryphon @sat up@#sit up# and rubbed#rub# its eyes#eye#: then it watched#watch# the Queen till
she was#be# out of sight: then it chuckled#chuckle#.|| ‘What fun!’ said#say# the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to Alice.||

‘What <i>is#be#</i> the fun?’ said#say# Alice.||

‘Why, <i>she</i>,’ said#say# the Gryphon.|| ‘It|’s#be# all her fancy, that: they never
executes#execute# nobody, you know. @Come on@!’||

‘Everybody#everybody# says#say# “@come on@!” here,’ thought#think# Alice, as she went#go# slowly
after it: ‘I never was#be# so ordered#order# about in all my life, never!’||

They had#have# not gone#go# far before they saw#see# the Mock Turtle in the distance,
sitting#sit# sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came#come#
nearer#near#, Alice could hear him sighing#sigh# as if his heart would break.|| She
pitied#pity# him deeply.|| ‘What is#be# his sorrow?’ she asked#ask# the Gryphon, and the
Gryphon answered#answer#, very nearly in the same words#word# as before, ‘It|’s#be# all his
fancy, that: he hasn’t got#get# no sorrow, you know. @Come on@!’||<page>

So they went#go# up to the Mock Turtle, who looked#look# at them with large eyes#eye#
full of tears#tear#, but said#say# nothing.||

‘This here young lady,’ said#say# the Gryphon, ‘she wants#want# for to know your
history, she do.’||

‘I|’ll#will# tell it her,’ said#say# the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: ‘@sit
down@, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I|’ve#have# finished#finish#.’||

So they @sat down@#sit down#, and nobody spoke#speak# for some minutes#minute#.|| Alice thought#think# to
herself, ‘I don’t see how he can <i>even</i> finish, if he doesn’t begin.’ But
she waited#wait# patiently.||

‘Once,’ said#say# the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, ‘I was#be# a real
Turtle.’||
<img src="33OnceIWasARealTurtle.jpg" width="269" height="318" alt="Alice meets the Mock Turtle"/>

These words#word# were#be# followed#follow# by a very long silence, broken#break# only by an
occasional exclamation of ‘Hjckrrh#hjckrrh#!’ from the Gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing#sob# of the Mock Turtle.|| Alice was#be# very nearly @getting up@#get up# and
saying#say#, ‘Thank#thank# you, sir, for your interesting story,’ but she could
not help thinking#think# there <i>must</i> be more to come, so she sat#sit# still and said#say#
nothing.||<page>

‘When we were#be# little,’ the Mock Turtle went#go# on at last, more calmly,
though still sobbing#sob# a little now and then, ‘we went#go# to school in the
sea.|| The master was#be# an old Turtle--we used#use# to call him Tortoise--’

‘Why did#do# you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?’ Alice asked#ask#.||

‘We called#call# him Tortoise because he taught#teach# us,’ said#say# the Mock Turtle
angrily: ‘really you are#be# very dull!’||

‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking#ask# such a simple question,’
added#add# the Gryphon;|| and then they both sat#sit# silent and looked#look# at poor
Alice, who felt#feel# ready to sink into the earth.|| At last the Gryphon said#say#
to the Mock Turtle, ‘Drive on, old fellow!|| Don’t be all day about it!’
and he went#go# on in these words#word#:

‘Yes, we went#go# to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it--’||

‘I never said#say# I didn’t!’ interrupted#interrupt# Alice.||

‘You did#do#,’ said#say# the Mock Turtle.||

‘Hold your tongue!’ added#add# the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.||
The Mock Turtle went#go# on.||

‘We had#have# the best of educations#education#--in fact, we went#go# to school every day--’||<page>

‘<i>I|’ve#have#</i> been#be# to a day-#day#|school, too,’ said#say# Alice; ‘you needn’t be so proud
as all that.’||

‘With extras#extra#?’ asked#ask# the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.||

‘Yes,’ said#say# Alice, ‘we learned#learn# French and music.’

‘And washing#wash#?’ said#say# the Mock Turtle.||

‘Certainly not!’ said#say# Alice indignantly.||

‘Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,’ said#say# the Mock Turtle in
a tone of great relief.|| ‘Now at <i>ours</i> they had#have# at the end of the bill,
“French, music, <i>and washing</i>--extra.”’||

‘You couldn’t have wanted#want# it much,’ said#say# Alice; ‘living at the bottom of
the sea.’||

‘I couldn’t afford to learn it.’ said#say# the Mock Turtle with a sigh. ‘I
only took#take# the regular course.’||

‘What was#be# that?’ inquired#inquire# Alice.||

‘Reeling and Writhing, @of course@, to begin with,’ the Mock Turtle
replied#reply#;|| ‘and then the different branches#branch# of Arithmetic--Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.’||

‘I never heard#hear# of “Uglification,”’ Alice ventured#venture# to say. ‘What is#be# it?’||

The Gryphon lifted#lift# up both its paws#paw# in surprise.|| ‘What! Never heard#hear# of
uglifying#uglify#!’ it exclaimed#exclaim#. ‘You know what to beautify is#be#, I suppose?’||<page>

‘Yes,’ said#say# Alice doubtfully: ‘it means#mean#--to--make--anything--prettier.’||

‘Well, then,’ the Gryphon went#go# on, ‘if you don’t know what to uglify is#be#,
you <i>are#be#</i> a simpleton.’||

Alice did#do# not feel encouraged#encourage# to ask any more questions#question# about it, so she
turned#turn# to the Mock Turtle, and said#say# ‘What else had#have# you to learn?’||

‘Well, there was#be# Mystery,’ the Mock Turtle replied#reply#, counting#count# off
the subjects#subject# on his flappers#flapper#, ‘--Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography:|| then Drawling--the Drawling-|master was#be# an old conger-eel,
that used#use# to come once a week: <i>he</i> taught#teach# us Drawling, Stretching#stretch#, and
Fainting#faint# in Coils#coil#.’||

‘What was#be# <i>that</i> like?’ said#say# Alice.||

‘Well, I can’t show it you myself,’ the Mock Turtle said#say#: ‘I|’m#be# too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt#learn# it.’||

‘Hadn’t#hadn’t# time,’ said#say# the Gryphon: ‘I went#go# to the Classics master, though.
He was#be# an old crab, <i>he</i> was#be#.’||<page>

‘I never went#go# to him,’ the Mock Turtle said#say# with a sigh: ‘he taught#teach#
Laughing#laugh# and Grief, they used#use# to say.’||

‘So he did#do#, so he did#do#,’ said#say# the Gryphon, sighing#sigh# in his turn; and both
creatures#creature# hid#hide# their faces#face# in their paws#paw#.||

‘And how many hours#hour# a day did#do# you do lessons#lesson#?’ said#say# Alice, in a hurry to
change the subject.||

‘Ten hours#hour# the first day,’ said#say# the Mock Turtle: ‘nine the next, and so
on.’

‘What a curious plan!’ exclaimed#exclaim# Alice.||

‘That|’s#be# the reason they’re#be# called#call# lessons#lesson#,’ the Gryphon remarked#remark#:
‘because they lessen from day to day.’||

This was#be# quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought#think# it over a little
before she made#make# her next remark.|| ‘Then the eleventh day must have been#be# a
holiday?’

‘@Of course@ it was#be#,’ said#say# the Mock Turtle.||

‘And how did#do# you manage on the twelfth?’ Alice went#go# on eagerly.||

‘That|’s#be# enough about lessons#lesson#,’ the Gryphon interrupted#interrupt# in a very decided#decide#
tone: ‘tell her something about the games#game# now.’||<page>

<h2>CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille||</h2>

The Mock Turtle sighed#sigh# deeply, and drew#draw# the back of one flapper across
his eyes#eye#.|| He looked#look# at Alice, and tried#try# to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs#sob# choked#choke# his voice.|| ‘Same#same# as if he had#have# a bone in his throat,’
said#say# the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking#shake# him and punching#punch# him in
the back.|| At last the Mock Turtle recovered#recover# his voice, and, with tears#tear#
running#run# down his cheeks#cheek#, he went#go# on again:--||

‘You may not have lived#live# much under the sea--’ (‘I haven’t,’ said#say#
Alice)--‘and perhaps you were#be# never even introduced#introduce# to a lobster--’||
(Alice began#begin# to say ‘I once tasted#taste#--’ but checked#check# herself hastily, and
said#say# ‘No, never’) ‘--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is#be#!’||

‘No, indeed,’ said#say# Alice. ‘What sort of a dance is#be# it?’||
<img src="34TheLobsterQuadrille.jpg" width="282" height="339" alt="The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance a Lobster Quadrille"/><page>

‘Why,’ said#say# the Gryphon, ‘you first form into a line along the
sea-#sea#|shore--’||

‘Two lines#line#!’ cried#cry# the Mock Turtle.|| ‘Seals#seal#, turtles#turtle#, salmon, and so on;
then, when you|’ve#have# cleared#clear# all the jelly-fish out of the way--’||

‘<i>That</i> generally takes#take# some time,’ interrupted#interrupt# the Gryphon.||

‘--you advance twice--’

‘Each with a lobster as a partner!’ cried#cry# the Gryphon.||

‘@Of course@,’ the Mock Turtle said#say#: ‘advance twice, set to partners#partner#--’

‘--change lobsters#lobster#, and retire in same order,’ continued#continue# the Gryphon.||

‘Then, you know,’ the Mock Turtle went#go# on, ‘you throw the--’

‘The lobsters#lobster#!’ shouted#shout# the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.||

‘--as far out to sea as you can--’

‘Swim after them!’ screamed#scream# the Gryphon.||

‘Turn a somersault in the sea!’ cried#cry# the Mock Turtle, capering#caper# wildly
about.||

‘Change lobsters#lobster# again!’ yelled#yell# the Gryphon at the top of its voice.||<page>

‘Back to land again, and that|’s#be# all the first figure,’ said#say# the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping#drop# his voice;|| and the two creatures#creature#, who had#have# been#be#
jumping#jump# about like mad things#thing# all this time, @sat down@#sit down# again very sadly
and quietly, and looked#look# at Alice.||

‘It must be a very pretty dance,’ said#say# Alice timidly.||

‘Would you like to see a little of it?’ said#say# the Mock Turtle.||

‘Very much indeed,’ said#say# Alice.||

‘Come, let|’s#us# try the first figure!’ said#say# the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.||
‘We can do without lobsters#lobster#, you know. Which shall sing?’||

‘Oh, <i>you</i> sing,’ said#say# the Gryphon. ‘I|’ve#have# forgotten#forget# the words#word#.’||

So they began#begin# solemnly dancing#dance# round and round Alice, every now and
then treading#tread# on her toes#toe# when they passed#pass# too close, and waving#wave# their
forepaws#forepaw# to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang#sing# this, very slowly
and sadly:--||<page>

 ‘“Will you walk a little faster#fast#?” said#say# a whiting to a snail.
 “There|’s#be# a porpoise close behind us, and he|’s#be# treading#tread# on my tail.||

 See how eagerly the lobsters#lobster# and the turtles#turtle# all advance!
 They are#be# waiting#wait# on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?||

 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?||

 “You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
 When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters#lobster#, out to sea!”||
  But the snail replied#reply# “Too#too# far, too far!” and gave#give# a look askance--
 Said#say# he thanked#thank# the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.||

 Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
 Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.||

 ‘“What matters#matter# it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied#reply#.
 “There is#be# another shore, you know, upon the other side.||
 The further off from England#england# the nearer#near# is#be# to France#france#--
 Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.||

 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
 Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”’||<page>

‘Thank you, it|’s#be# a very interesting dance to watch,’ said#say# Alice, feeling#feel#
very glad that it was#be# over at last: ‘and I do so like that curious song
about the whiting!’||

‘Oh, as to the whiting,’ said#say# the Mock Turtle, ‘they--you|’ve#have# seen#see# them,
@of course@?’||

‘Yes,’ said#say# Alice, ‘I|’ve#have# often seen#see# them at dinn--’ she checked#check# herself
hastily.||

‘I don’t know where Dinn#dinn# may be,’ said#say# the Mock Turtle, ‘but if you|’ve#have#
seen#see# them so often, @of course@ you know what they’re#be# like.’||

‘I believe so,’ Alice replied#reply# thoughtfully. ‘They have their tails#tail# in
their mouths#mouth#--and they’re#be# all over crumbs#crumb#.’||

‘You’re#be# wrong about the crumbs#crumb#,’ said#say# the Mock Turtle: ‘crumbs#crumb# would all
wash off in the sea.|| But they <i>have</i> their tails#tail# in their mouths#mouth#;|| and the
reason is#be#--’ here the Mock Turtle yawned#yawn# and shut his eyes#eye#.--‘Tell#tell# her
about the reason and all that,’ he said#say# to the Gryphon.||<page>

‘The reason is#be#,’ said#say# the Gryphon, ‘that they <i>would</i> go with the lobsters#lobster#
to the dance.|| So they got#get# thrown#throw# out to sea.|| So they had#have# to fall a long
way. So they got#get# their tails#tail# fast in their mouths#mouth#.|| So they couldn’t get
them out again. That|’s#be# all.’||

‘Thank you,’ said#say# Alice, ‘it|’s#be# very interesting. I never knew#know# so much
about a whiting before.’||

‘I can tell you more than that, if you like,’ said#say# the Gryphon. ‘Do you
know why it|’s#be# called#call# a whiting?’||

‘I never thought#think# about it,’ said#say# Alice. ‘Why?’||

‘<i>It does#do# the boots#boot# and shoes#shoe#</i>.’ the Gryphon replied#reply# very solemnly.||

Alice was#be# thoroughly puzzled#puzzle#. ‘Does#do# the boots#boot# and shoes#shoe#!’ she repeated#repeat#
in a wondering#wonder# tone.||

‘Why, what are#be# <i>your</i> shoes#shoe# done#do# with?’ said#say# the Gryphon. ‘I mean, what
makes#make# them so shiny?’||

Alice looked#look# down at them, and considered#consider# a little before she gave#give# her
answer. ‘They’re#be# done#do# with blacking, I believe.’||

‘Boots#boot# and shoes#shoe# under the sea,’ the Gryphon went#go# on in a deep voice,
‘are#be# done#do# with a whiting. Now you know.’||<page>

‘And what are#be# they made#make# of?’ Alice asked#ask# in a tone of great curiosity.||

‘Soles#sole# and eels#eel#, @of course@,’ the Gryphon replied#reply# rather impatiently:
‘any shrimp could have told#tell# you that.’||

‘If I|’d#had# been#be# the whiting,’ said#say# Alice, whose thoughts#thought# were#be# still running#run#
on the song, ‘I|’d#would# have said#say# to the porpoise, “Keep#keep# back, please: we
don’t want <i>you</i> with us!”’||

‘They were#be# obliged#oblige# to have him with them,’ the Mock Turtle said#say#: ‘no
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.’||

‘Wouldn’t it really?’ said#say# Alice in a tone of great surprise.||

‘@Of course@ not,’ said#say# the Mock Turtle: ‘why, if a fish came#come# to <i>me</i>, and
told#tell# me he was#be# going#go# a journey, I should say “With what porpoise?”’||

‘Don’t you mean “purpose”?’ said#say# Alice.||

‘I mean what I say,’ the Mock Turtle replied#reply# in an offended#offend# tone. And
the Gryphon added#add# ‘Come, let|’s#us# hear some of <i>your</i> adventures#adventure#.’||<page>

‘I could tell you my adventures#adventure#--beginning#begin# from this morning,’ said#say#
Alice a little timidly:|| ‘but it|’s#be# no use going#go# back to yesterday,
because I was#be# a different person then.’||

‘Explain all that,’ said#say# the Mock Turtle.||

‘No, no! The adventures#adventure# first,’ said#say# the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
‘explanations#explanation# take such a dreadful time.’||

So Alice began#begin# telling#tell# them her adventures#adventure# from the time when she first
saw#see# the White Rabbit.|| She was#be# a little nervous about it just @at first@,
the two creatures#creature# got#get# so close to her, one on each side, and opened#open#
their eyes#eye# and mouths#mouth# so <i>very</i> wide, but she gained#gain# courage as she went#go#
on.|| Her listeners#listener# were#be# perfectly quiet till she got#get# to the part about
her repeating#repeat# ‘<i>You are#be# old, Father William</i>,’ to the Caterpillar, and the
words#word# all coming#come# different,|| and then the Mock Turtle drew#draw# a long breath,
and said#say# ‘That|’s#be# very curious.’||

‘It|’s#be# all about as curious as it can be,’ said#say# the Gryphon.||

‘It all came#come# different!’ the Mock Turtle repeated#repeat# thoughtfully. ‘I
should like to hear her try and repeat something now.|| Tell#tell# her to
begin.’ He looked#look# at the Gryphon as if he thought#think# it had#have# some kind of
authority over Alice.||<page>

‘Stand#stand# up and repeat “<i>‘Tis#’tis# the voice of the sluggard</i>,”’ said#say# the
Gryphon.||

‘How the creatures#creature# order one about, and make one repeat lessons#lesson#!’
thought#think# Alice; ‘I might as well be at school @at once@.’|| However, she
@got up@#get up#, and began#begin# to repeat it, but her head was#be# so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew#know# what she was#be# saying#say#, and the words#word# came#come#
very queer indeed:--||
<img src="35TisTheVoiceOfTheLobster.jpg" width="197" height="344" alt="The Lobster at his dressing-table"/><page>

  ‘’Tis#’tis# the voice of the Lobster#lobster#; I heard#hear# him declare,
  “You have baked#bake# me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”||
   As a duck with its eyelids#eyelid#, so he with his nose
  Trims#trim# his belt and his buttons#button#, and turns#turn# out his toes#toe#.’||

  When the sands#sand# are#be# all dry, he is#be# gay as a lark,
  And will talk in contemptuous tones#tone# of the Shark#shark#,||
  But, when the tide rises#rise# and sharks#shark# are#be# around,
  His#his# voice has#have# a timid and tremulous sound.||

‘That|’s#be# different from what I used#use# to say when I was#be# a child,’ said#say# the
Gryphon.||

‘Well, I never heard#hear# it before,’ said#say# the Mock Turtle; ‘but it sounds#sound#
uncommon nonsense.’||<page>

Alice said#say# nothing; she had#have# @sat down@#sit down# with her face in her hands#hand#,
wondering#wonder# if anything would <i>ever</i> happen in a natural way again.||

‘I should like to have it explained#explain#,’ said#say# the Mock Turtle.||

‘She can’t explain it,’ said#say# the Gryphon hastily. ‘Go#go# on with the next
verse.’||

‘But about his toes#toe#?’ the Mock Turtle persisted#persist#. ‘How <i>could</i> he turn them
out with his nose, you know?’||

‘It|’s#be# the first position in dancing#dance#.’ Alice said#say#; but was#be# dreadfully
puzzled#puzzle# by the whole thing, and longed#long# to change the subject.||

‘Go#go# on with the next verse,’ the Gryphon repeated#repeat# impatiently: ‘it
begins#begin# “I passed#pass# by his garden.”’||

Alice did#do# not dare to disobey, though she felt#feel# sure it would all come
wrong, and she went#go# on in a trembling#tremble# voice:--||

  ‘I passed#pass# by his garden, and marked#mark#, with one eye,
  How the Owl and the Panther were#be# sharing#share# a pie--’||
  The Panther took#take# pie-|crust, and gravy, and meat,
  While the Owl had#have# the dish as its share of the treat.||
  When the pie was#be# all finished#finish#, the Owl, as a boon,
  Was#be# kindly permitted#permit# to pocket the spoon:||
  While the Panther received#receive# knife and fork with a growl,
  And concluded#conclude# the banquet--||<page>

‘What <i>is#be#</i> the use of repeating#repeat# all that stuff,’ the Mock Turtle
interrupted#interrupt#, ‘if you don’t explain it as you go on? It|’s#be# by far the most
confusing thing I ever heard#hear#!’||

‘Yes, I think you|’d#had# better#good# @leave off@,’ said#say# the Gryphon: and Alice was#be#
only too glad to do so.||

‘Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?’ the Gryphon went#go#
on.|| ‘Or#or# would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?’||

‘Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,’ Alice
replied#reply#, so eagerly that the Gryphon said#say#, in a rather offended#offend# tone,
‘Hm! No accounting for tastes#taste#!|| Sing her “Turtle Soup#soup#,” will you, old
fellow?’||<page>

The Mock Turtle sighed#sigh# deeply, and began#begin#, in a voice sometimes choked#choke#
with sobs#sob#, to sing this:--||

   ‘Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
   Waiting#wait# in a hot tureen!||
   Who for such dainties#dainty# would not stoop?

   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!||

‘Chorus again!’ cried#cry# the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had#have# just begun#begin#
to repeat it, when a cry of ‘The trial|’s#be# beginning#begin#!’ was#be# heard#hear# in the
distance.||

‘@Come on@!’ cried#cry# the Gryphon, and, taking#take# Alice by the hand, it hurried#hurry#
off, without waiting#wait# for the end of the song.||

‘What trial is#be# it?’ Alice panted#pant# as she ran#run#;|| but the Gryphon only

   ‘@Soo--oop@#soup# of the @e--e--evening@#evening#,

<h2>CHAPTER XI. Who Stole#steal# the Tarts#tart#?||</h2>

The King and Queen of Hearts#heart# were#be# seated#seat# on their throne when they
arrived#arrive#, with a great crowd assembled#assemble# about them--||all sorts#sort# of little
birds#bird# and beasts#beast#, as well as the whole pack of cards#card#:|| the Knave was#be#
standing#stand# before them, in chains#chain#, with a soldier on each side to guard
him;|| and near the King was#be# the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,
and a scroll of parchment in the other.|| In the very middle of the court
was#be# a table, with a large dish of tarts#tart# upon it:|| they looked#look# so good,
that it made#make# Alice quite hungry to look at them--||‘I wish they|’d#would# get the
trial done#do#,’ she thought#think#, ‘and hand round the refreshments#refreshment#!’|| But there
seemed#seem# to be no chance of this, so she began#begin# looking#look# at everything about
her, to pass away the time.||<page>

Alice had#have# never been#be# in a court of justice before, but she had#have# read
about them in books#book#, and she was#be# quite pleased#please# to find that she knew#know#
the name of nearly everything there.|| ‘That|’s#be# the judge,’ she said#say# to
herself, ‘because of his great wig.’||

The judge, by the way, was#be# the King; and as he wore#wear# his crown over the
wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did#do# it,)|| he did#do#
not look @at all@ comfortable, and it was#be# certainly not becoming#become#.||

‘And that|’s#be# the jury-|box,’ thought#think# Alice, ‘and those twelve creatures#creature#,’
(she was#be# obliged#oblige# to say ‘creatures#creature#,’ you see, because some of them were#be#
animals#animal#, and some were#be# birds#bird#,) ‘I suppose they are#be# the jurors#juror#.’|| She said#say#
this last word two or three times#time# over to herself, being#be# rather proud of
it:|| for she thought#think#, and rightly too, that very few little girls#girl# of her
age knew#know# the meaning of it @at all@.|| However, ‘jury-|men#man#’ would have done#do#
just as well.||

The twelve jurors#juror# were#be# all writing#write# very busily on slates#slate#.|| ‘What are#be# they
doing#do#?’ Alice whispered#whisper# to the Gryphon. ‘They can’t have anything to put
down yet, before the trial|’s#be# begun#begin#.’||<page>

‘They’re#be# putting#put# down their names#name#,’ the Gryphon whispered#whisper# in reply, ‘for
fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.’||

‘Stupid#stupid# things#thing#!’ Alice began#begin# in a loud, indignant voice,|| but she stopped#stop#
hastily, for the White Rabbit cried#cry# out, ‘Silence in the court!’ and the
King put on his spectacles#spectacle# and looked#look# anxiously round, to make out who
was#be# talking#talk#.||
<img src="36SilenceInTheCourt.jpg" width="217" height="305" alt="The White Rabbit blows his trumpet"/>

Alice could see, as well as if she were#be# looking#look# over their shoulders#shoulder#,
that all the jurors#juror# were#be# writing#write# down ‘stupid things#thing#!’ on their slates#slate#,||
and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell
‘stupid,’ and that he had#have# to ask his neighbour to tell him.|| ‘A nice
muddle their slates#slate#|’ll#will# be in before the trial|’s#be# over!’ thought#think# Alice.||

One of the jurors#juror# had#have# a pencil that squeaked#squeak#.|| This @of course@, Alice
could not stand, and she went#go# round the court and got#get# behind him, and
very soon found#find# an opportunity of taking#take# it away.|| She did#do# it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was#be# Bill, the Lizard#lizard#) could not make out
@at all@ what had#have# become of it;|| so, after hunting#hunt# all about for it, he was#be#
obliged#oblige# to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was#be#
of very little use, as it left#leave# no mark on the slate.||<page>

‘Herald, read the accusation!’ said#say# the King.||

On this the White Rabbit blew#blow# three blasts#blast# on the trumpet, and then
unrolled#unroll# the parchment scroll, and read as follows#follow#:--||

   ‘The Queen of Hearts#heart#, she made#make# some tarts#tart#,
      All on a summer day:||
    The Knave of Hearts#heart#, he stole#steal# those tarts#tart#,
      And took#take# them quite away!’||

‘Consider your verdict,’ the King said#say# to the jury.||

‘Not yet, not yet!’ the Rabbit hastily interrupted#interrupt#. ‘There|’s#be# a great
deal to come before that!’||

‘Call the first witness,’ said#say# the King;|| and the White Rabbit blew#blow# three
blasts#blast# on the trumpet, and called#call# out, ‘First witness!’||

The first witness was#be# the Hatter. He came#come# in with a teacup in one
hand and a piece of bread-|and-|butter in the other.|| ‘I beg pardon, your
Majesty,’ he began#begin#, ‘for bringing#bring# these in: but I hadn’t quite finished#finish#
my tea when I was#be# @sent for@#send for#.’||<page>

‘You ought to have finished#finish#,’ said#say# the King. ‘When did#do# you begin?’||

The Hatter looked#look# at the March Hare, who had#have# followed#follow# him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.|| ‘Fourteenth of March, I think it
was#be#,’ he said#say#.

‘Fifteenth,’ said#say# the March Hare.

‘Sixteenth,’ added#add# the Dormouse.||

‘Write that down,’ the King said#say# to the jury,|| and the jury eagerly
wrote#write# down all three dates#date# on their slates#slate#, and then added#add# them up, and
reduced#reduce# the answer to shillings#shilling# and pence#penny#.||

‘Take off your hat,’ the King said#say# to the Hatter.||

‘It isn’t mine,’ said#say# the Hatter.||

‘Stolen!’ the King exclaimed#exclaim#, turning#turn# to the jury, who instantly made#make# a
memorandum of the fact.||

‘I keep them to sell,’ the Hatter added#add# as an explanation; ‘I|’ve#have# none of
my own. I|’m#be# a hatter.’||

Here the Queen put on her spectacles#spectacle#, and began#begin# staring#stare# at the Hatter,
who turned#turn# pale and fidgeted#fidget#.||<page>

‘Give your evidence,’ said#say# the King; ‘and don’t be nervous, or I|’ll#will# have
you executed#execute# on the spot.’||

This did#do# not seem to encourage the witness @at all@: he kept#keep# shifting#shift#
from one foot to the other, looking#look# uneasily at the Queen,|| and in
his confusion he bit#bite# a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-|and-|butter.||

Just at this moment Alice felt#feel# a very curious sensation, which puzzled#puzzle#
her a good deal until she made#make# out what it was#be#:|| she was#be# beginning#begin# to
grow larger#large# again, and she thought#think# @at first@ she would @get up@ and leave
the court;|| but on second thoughts#thought# she decided#decide# to remain where she was#be# as
long as there was#be# room for her.||

‘I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.’ said#say# the Dormouse, who was#be# sitting#sit#
next to her. ‘I can hardly breathe.’||

‘I can’t help it,’ said#say# Alice very meekly: ‘I|’m#be# growing#grow#.’||

‘You|’ve#have# no right to grow here,’ said#say# the Dormouse.||<page>

‘Don’t talk nonsense,’ said#say# Alice more boldly: ‘you know you|’re#be# growing#grow#
too.’||

‘Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,’ said#say# the Dormouse: ‘not in that
ridiculous fashion.’|| And he @got up@#get up# very sulkily and crossed#cross# over to the
other side of the court.||

All this time the Queen had#have# never @left off@#leave off# staring#stare# at the Hatter,|| and,
just as the Dormouse crossed#cross# the court, she said#say# to one of the officers#officer#
of the court, ‘Bring me the list of the singers#singer# in the last concert!’|| on
which the wretched Hatter trembled#tremble# so, that he shook#shake# both his shoes#shoe# off.||

‘Give your evidence,’ the King repeated#repeat# angrily, ‘or I|’ll#will# have you
executed#execute#, whether you|’re#be# nervous or not.’||

‘I|’m#be# a poor man, your Majesty,’ the Hatter began#begin#, in a trembling#tremble# voice,||
‘--and I hadn’t begun#begin# my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the
bread-|and-|butter getting#get# so thin--and the twinkling#twinkle# of the tea--’||
<img src="37ImAPoorMan.jpg" width="192" height="268" alt="The Mad Hatter giving his evidence"/>

‘The twinkling#twinkle# of the what?’ said#say# the King.||

‘It began#begin# with the tea,’ the Hatter replied#reply#.||

‘@Of course@ twinkling#twinkle# begins#begin# with a T!’ said#say# the King sharply. ‘Do you
take me for a dunce? Go#go# on!’||<page>

‘I|’m#be# a poor man,’ the Hatter went#go# on, ‘and most things#thing# twinkled#twinkle# after
that--only the March Hare said#say#--’||

‘I didn’t!’ the March Hare interrupted#interrupt# in a great hurry.||

‘You did#do#!’ said#say# the Hatter.

‘I deny it!’ said#say# the March Hare.||

‘He denies#deny# it,’ said#say# the King: ‘leave out that part.’||

‘Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said#say#--’ the Hatter went#go# on, looking#look#
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too:|| but the Dormouse denied#deny#
nothing, being#be# fast asleep.||

‘After that,’ continued#continue# the Hatter, ‘I cut some more bread-|and-|butter--’||

‘But what did#do# the Dormouse say?’ one of the jury asked#ask#.||

‘That I can’t remember,’ said#say# the Hatter.||

‘You <i>must</i> remember,’ remarked#remark# the King, ‘or I|’ll#will# have you executed#execute#.’||

The miserable Hatter dropped#drop# his teacup and bread-|and-|butter, and went#go#
down on one knee.|| ‘I|’m#be# a poor man, your Majesty,’ he began#begin#.||

‘You’re#be# a very poor speaker,’ said#say# the King.||<page>

Here one of the guinea-pigs#guinea-pig# cheered#cheer#, and was#be# immediately suppressed#suppress# by
the officers#officer# of the court.|| (As that is#be# rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was#be# done#do#.|| They had#have# a large canvas bag, which tied#tie#
up at the mouth with strings#string#: into this they slipped#slip# the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat#sit# upon it.)||

‘I|’m#be# glad I|’ve#have# seen#see# that done#do#,’ thought#think# Alice.|| ‘I|’ve#have# so often read
in the newspapers#newspaper#, at the end of trials#trial#, “There was#be# some attempts#attempt#
at applause, which was#be# immediately suppressed#suppress# by the officers#officer# of the
court,” and I never understood#understand# what it meant#mean# till now.’||

‘If that|’s#be# all you know about it, you may stand down,’ continued#continue# the
King.||

‘I can’t go no lower#low#,’ said#say# the Hatter: ‘I|’m#be# on the floor, as it is#be#.’||

‘Then you may @<i>sit</i> down@,’ the King replied#reply#.||

Here the other guinea-pig cheered#cheer#, and was#be# suppressed#suppress#.||

‘Come, that finished#finish# the guinea-pigs#guinea-pig#!’ thought#think# Alice. ‘Now we shall @get
on@ better#good#.’||

‘I|’d#would# rather finish my tea,’ said#say# the Hatter, with an anxious look at the
Queen, who was#be# reading#read# the list of singers#singer#.||<page>

‘You may go,’ said#say# the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left#leave# the court,
without even waiting#wait# to put his shoes#shoe# on.||
<img src="38HurriedlyLeftTheCourt.jpg" width="250" height="199" alt="The Mad Hatter leaves without his shoes"/>

‘--and just take his head off outside,’ the Queen added#add# to one of the
officers#officer#: but the Hatter was#be# out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.||

‘Call the next witness!’ said#say# the King.||

The next witness was#be# the Duchess|’s cook.|| She carried#carry# the pepper-#pepper#|box in
her hand, and Alice guessed#guess# who it was#be#, even before she got#get# into the
court, by the way the people near the door began#begin# sneezing#sneeze# all @at once@.||

‘Give your evidence,’ said#say# the King.

‘Shan’t#shan’t#,’ said#say# the cook.||

The King looked#look# anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said#say# in a low voice,
‘Your Majesty must cross-examine <i>this</i> witness.’||

‘Well, if I must, I must,’ the King said#say#, with a melancholy air,|| and,
after folding#fold# his arms#arm# and frowning#frown# at the cook till his eyes#eye# were#be#
nearly out of sight, he said#say# in a deep voice, ‘What are#be# tarts#tart# made#make# of?’||

‘Pepper, mostly,’ said#say# the cook.<page>

‘Treacle,’ said#say# a sleepy voice behind her.||

‘Collar that Dormouse,’ the Queen shrieked#shriek# out. ‘Behead#behead# that Dormouse!||
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress#suppress# him! Pinch#pinch# him! Off with his
whiskers#whisker#!’||

For some minutes#minute# the whole court was#be# in confusion, getting#get# the Dormouse

‘Never mind!’ said#say# the King, with an air of great relief. ‘Call the next

<i>you</i> must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes#make# my forehead

Alice watched#watch# the White Rabbit as he fumbled#fumble# over the list, feeling#feel# very

<h2>CHAPTER XII. Alice|’s Evidence||</h2>

‘Here!’ cried#cry# Alice, quite forgetting#forget# in the flurry of the moment how
large she had#have# grown#grow# in the last few minutes#minute#,|| and she jumped#jump# up in such
a hurry that she tipped#tip# over the jury-|box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting#upset# all the jury|men#man# on to the heads#head# of the crowd below,|| and there
they lay sprawling#sprawl# about, reminding#remind# her very much of a globe of goldfish
she had#have# accidentally upset the week before.||
<img src="39UpsettingAllTheJurymen.jpg" width="272" height="332" alt="Alice knocks over the jury-box"/>

‘Oh, I @<i>beg</i> your pardon@#beg someone's pardon#!’ she exclaimed#exclaim# in a tone of great dismay,|| and
began#begin# picking#pick# them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of
the goldfish kept#keep# running#run# in her head,|| and she had#have# a vague sort of idea
that they must be collected#collect# @at once@ and put back into the jury-|box, or
they would die.||

‘The trial cannot proceed,’ said#say# the King in a very grave voice, ‘until
all the jury|men#man# are#be# back in their proper places#place#--<i>all</i>,’ he repeated#repeat# with
great emphasis, looking#look# hard at Alice as he said#say# do.||<page>

Alice looked#look# at the jury-|box, and saw#see# that, in her haste, she had#have# put
the Lizard#lizard# in head downwards, and the poor little thing was#be# waving#wave# its
tail about in a melancholy way, being#be# quite unable to move.|| She soon got#get#
it out again, and put it right; ‘not that it signifies#signify# much,’ she said#say#
to herself; ‘I should think it would be <i>quite</i> as much use in the trial
one way up as the other.’||

As soon as the jury had#have# a little recovered#recover# from the shock of being#be#
upset, and their slates#slate# and pencils#pencil# had#have# been#be# found#find# and handed#hand# back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident,|| all except the Lizard#lizard#, who seemed#seem# too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing#gaze# up into the roof of the
court.||

‘What do you know about this business?’ the King said#say# to Alice.||

‘Nothing,’ said#say# Alice.

‘Nothing <i>whatever</i>?’ persisted#persist# the King.

‘Nothing whatever,’ said#say# Alice.||<page>

‘That|’s#be# very important,’ the King said#say#, turning#turn# to the jury.|| They were#be#
just beginning#begin# to write this down on their slates#slate#, when the White Rabbit
interrupted#interrupt#: ‘<i>Un</i>important#unimportant#, your Majesty means#mean#, @of course@,’ he said#say# in a
very respectful tone, but frowning#frown# and making#make# faces#face# at him as he spoke#speak#.||

‘<i>Un</i>important#unimportant#, @of course@, I meant#mean#,’ the King hastily said#say#, and went#go# on
to himself in an undertone,

‘important--unimportant--unimportant--important--’ as if he were#be# trying#try#
which word sounded#sound# best.||

Some of the jury wrote#write# it down ‘important,’ and some ‘unimportant.’||
Alice could see this, as she was#be# near enough to look over their slates#slate#;
‘but it doesn’t matter a bit,’ she thought#think# to herself.||

At this moment the King, who had#have# been#be# for some time busily writing#write# in
his note-book, cackled#cackle# out ‘Silence!’ and read out from his book, ‘Rule
Forty-two. <i>All persons#person# more than a mile high to leave the court</i>.’||

Everybody looked#look# at Alice.||

‘<i>I’m#be#</i> not a mile high,’ said#say# Alice.

‘You are#be#,’ said#say# the King.

‘Nearly two miles#mile# high,’ added#add# the Queen.||<page>

‘Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,’ said#say# Alice: ‘besides, that|’s#be# not a
regular rule: you invented#invent# it just now.’||

‘It|’s#be# the oldest#old# rule in the book,’ said#say# the King.

‘Then it ought to be Number One,’ said#say# Alice.||

The King turned#turn# pale, and shut his note-book hastily. ‘Consider your
verdict,’ he said#say# to the jury, in a low, trembling#tremble# voice.||

‘There|’s#be# more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,’ said#say# the White
Rabbit, jumping#jump# up in a great hurry; ‘this paper has#have# just been#be# picked#pick#
up.’||

‘What|’s#be# in it?’ said#say# the Queen.||

‘I haven’t opened#open# it yet,’ said#say# the White Rabbit, ‘but it seems#seem# to be a
letter, written#write# by the prisoner to--to somebody.’||

‘It must have been#be# that,’ said#say# the King, ‘unless it was#be# written#write# to
nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.’||

‘Who is#be# it directed#direct# to?’ said#say# one of the jury|men#man#.||

‘It isn’t directed#direct# @at all@,’ said#say# the White Rabbit; ‘in fact, there|’s#be#
nothing written#write# on the <i>outside</i>.’|| He unfolded#unfold# the paper as he spoke#speak#, and
added#add# ‘It isn’t a letter, @after all@: it|’s#be# a set of verses#verse#.’||<page>

‘Are#be# they in the prisoner|’s handwriting#handwrite#?’asked#ask# another of the jury|men#man#.||

‘No, they’re#be# not,’ said#say# the White Rabbit, ‘and that|’s#be# the queerest#queer# thing
about it.’ (The jury all looked#look# puzzled#puzzle#.)||

‘He must have imitated#imitate# somebody else|’s hand,’ said#say# the King.|| (The jury
all brightened#brighten# up again.)||

‘Please your Majesty,’ said#say# the Knave, ‘I didn’t write it, and they
can’t prove I did#do#: there|’s#be# no name signed#sign# at the end.’||

‘If you didn’t sign it,’ said#say# the King, ‘that only makes#make# the matter
worse#bad#. You <i>must</i> have meant#mean# some mischief, or else you|’d#would# have signed#sign# your
name like an honest man.’||

There was#be# a general clapping of hands#hand# at this: it was#be# the first really
clever thing the King had#have# said#say# that day.||

‘That <i>proves#prove#</i> his guilt,’ said#say# the Queen.||

‘It proves#prove# nothing of the sort!’ said#say# Alice. ‘Why, you don’t even know
what they’re#be# about!’||

‘Read them,’ said#say# the King.||<page>

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles#spectacle#. ‘Where shall I begin, please
your Majesty?’ he asked#ask#.||

‘Begin at the beginning,’ the King said#say# gravely, ‘and go on till you
come to the end: then stop.’||

These were#be# the verses#verse# the White Rabbit read:--||

   ‘They told#tell# me you had#have# been#be# to her,
    And mentioned#mention# me to him:||
   She gave#give# me a good character,
    But said#say# I could not swim.||

   He sent#send# them word I had#have# not gone#go#
    (We know it to be true):||
   If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?||

   I gave#give# her one, they gave#give# him two,
    You gave#give# us three or more;||
   They all returned#return# from him to you,
    Though they were#be# mine before.||

   If I or she should chance to be
    Involved#involve# in this affair,||
   He trusts#trust# to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were#be#.||<page>

   My notion was#be# that you had#have# been#be#
    (Before she had#have# this fit)||
   An obstacle that came#come# between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.||

   Don’t let him know she liked#like# them best,
    For this must ever be||
   A secret, kept#keep# from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.’||

‘That|’s#be# the most important piece of evidence we|’ve#have# heard#hear# yet,’ said#say# the
King, rubbing#rub# his hands#hand#; ‘so now let the jury--’||

‘If any one of them can explain it,’ said#say# Alice, (she had#have# grown#grow# so large
in the last few minutes#minute# that she wasn’t a bit afraid of interrupting#interrupt#
him,) ‘I|’ll#will# give him sixpence.|| <i>I</i> don’t believe there|’s#be# an atom of
meaning in it.’||

The jury all wrote#write# down on their slates#slate#, ‘<i>She</i> doesn’t believe there|’s#be# an
atom of meaning in it,’ but none of them attempted#attempt# to explain the paper.||

‘If there|’s#be# no meaning in it,’ said#say# the King, ‘that saves#save# a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any.||<page> And yet I don’t know,’
he went#go# on, spreading#spread# out the verses#verse# on his knee, and looking#look# at them
with one eye;|| ‘I seem to see some meaning in them, @after all@. “--<i>said#say#
I could not swim</i>--” you can’t swim, can you?’ he added#add#, turning#turn# to the
Knave.||

The Knave shook#shake# his head sadly. ‘Do I look like it?’ he said#say#. (Which he
certainly did#do# <i>not</i>, being#be# made#make# entirely of cardboard.)||

‘All right, so far,’ said#say# the King, and he went#go# on muttering#mutter# over
the verses#verse# to himself:|| ‘<i>“We know it to be true--”</i> that|’s#be# the jury, @of
course@--||<i>“I gave#give# her one, they gave#give# him two--”</i> why, that must be what he
did#do# with the tarts#tart#, you know--’||

‘But, it goes#go# on <i>“They all returned#return# from him to you,”</i>’ said#say# Alice.||

‘Why, there they are#be#!’ said#say# the King triumphantly, pointing#point# to the tarts#tart#
on the table. ‘Nothing can be clearer#clear# than <i>that</i>.|| Then again--<i>“before she
had#have# this fit--”</i> you never had#have# fits#fit#, my dear, I think?’ he said#say# to the
Queen.||

‘Never!’ said#say# the Queen furiously, throwing#throw# an inkstand at the Lizard#lizard#
as she spoke#speak#.||<page> (The unfortunate little Bill had#have# @left off@#leave off# writing#write# on his
slate with one finger, as he found#find# it made#make# no mark; but he now hastily
began#begin# again, using#use# the ink, that was#be# trickling#trickle# down his face, as long as
it lasted#last#.)||

‘Then the words#word# don’t <i>fit</i> you,’ said#say# the King, looking#look# round the court
with a smile. There was#be# a dead silence.||

‘It|’s#be# a pun!’ the King added#add# in an offended#offend# tone, and everybody laughed#laugh#,||
‘Let the jury consider their verdict,’ the King said#say#, for about the
twentieth time that day.||

‘No, no!’ said#say# the Queen. ‘Sentence first--verdict afterwards.’||

‘Stuff and nonsense!’ said#say# Alice loudly. ‘The idea of having#have# the
sentence first!’||

‘Hold your tongue!’ said#say# the Queen, turning#turn# purple.

‘I won’t!’ said#say# Alice.||

‘Off with her head!’ the Queen shouted#shout# at the top of her voice. Nobody
moved#move#.||

‘Who @cares for@#care for# you?’ said#say# Alice, (she had#have# grown#grow# to her full size by this
time.) ‘You’re#be# nothing but a pack of cards#card#!’||
<img src="40NothingButAPackOfCards.jpg" width="274" height="376" alt="The cards fly at Alice"/><page>

At this the whole pack rose#rise# up into the air, and came#come# flying#fly# down upon
her:|| she gave#give# a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried#try# to beat them off, and found#find# herself lying#lie# on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was#be# gently brushing#brush# away some dead
leaves#leaf# that had#have# fluttered#flutter# down from the trees#tree# upon her face.||

‘Wake up, Alice dear!’ said#say# her sister; ‘Why, what a long sleep you|’ve#have#
had#have#!’||

‘Oh, I|’ve#have# had#have# such a curious dream!’ said#say# Alice, and she told#tell# her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures#adventure#
of hers that you have just been#be# reading#read# about;|| and when she had#have#
finished#finish#, her sister kissed#kiss# her, and said#say#, ‘It <i>was#be#</i> a curious dream,
dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it|’s#be# getting#get# late.’|| So
Alice @got up@#get up# and ran#run# off, thinking#think# while she ran#run#, as well she might,
what a wonderful dream it had#have# been#be#.||<page>

But her sister sat#sit# still just as she left#leave# her, leaning#lean# her head on her
hand, watching#watch# the setting sun, and thinking#think# of little Alice and all her
wonderful Adventures#adventure#, till she too began#begin# dreaming#dream# after a fashion, and
this was#be# her dream:--||

First, she dreamed#dream# of little Alice herself, and @once again@ the tiny
hands#hand# were#be# clasped#clasp# upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes#eye# were#be# looking#look#
up into hers--||she could hear the very tones#tone# of her voice, and see that
queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering#wander# hair that
<i>would</i> always get into her eyes#eye#--||and still as she listened#listen#, or seemed#seem# to
listen, the whole place around her became#become# alive with the strange creatures#creature#
of her little sister|’s dream.||

The long grass rustled#rustle# at her feet#foot# as the White Rabbit hurried#hurry# by--||the
frightened#frighten# Mouse splashed#splash# his way through the neighbouring pool--||she
could hear the rattle of the teacups#teacup# as the March Hare and his friends#friend#
shared#share# their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering#order# off her unfortunate guests#guest# to execution--||<page>@once more@ the pig-#pig#|baby
was#be# sneezing#sneeze# on the Duchess|’s knee, while plates#plate# and dishes#dish# crashed#crash#
around it--||@once more@ the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
Lizard|’s slate-#slate#|pencil, and the choking of the suppressed#suppress# guinea-pigs#guinea-pig#,
filled#fill# the air, mixed#mix# up with the distant sobs#sob# of the miserable Mock
Turtle.||

So she sat#sit# on, with closed#close# eyes#eye#, and half believed#believe# herself in
Wonderland, though she knew#know# she had#have# but to open them again, and all
would change to dull reality--||the grass would be only rustling#rustle# in the
wind, and the pool rippling#ripple# to the waving#wave# of the reeds#reed#--||the rattling#rattle#
teacups#teacup# would change to tinkling#tinkle# sheep-|bells#bell#, and the Queen|’s shrill
cries#cry# to the voice of the shepherd boy--||and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises#noise#, would change (she
knew#know#) to the confused#confuse# clamour of the busy farm-yard--||while the lowing
of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle|’s
heavy sobs#sob#.||

Lastly, she pictured#picture# to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown#grow# woman;|| and how she would
keep, through all her riper years#year#, the simple and loving#love# heart of her
childhood:||<page> and how she would gather about her other little children#child#, and
make <i>their</i> eyes#eye# bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even
with the dream of Wonderland of long ago:|| and how she would feel with
all their simple sorrows#sorrow#, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys#joy#,
remembering#remember# her own child-|life, and the happy summer days#day#.||

              THE END||
